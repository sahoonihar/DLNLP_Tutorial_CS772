129,"This lip plumper really works! Wasn't sure what to expect, but what an amazing product! Will definitely purchase again!",5

300,"Smaller than expected they did arrive way faster than promised, but after wearing them my ears are killing me!!! Very low quality metal.",1
301,Cannot open!  I have to go to a bench jeweler to see if they can.,1
302,"Too small, thought they  would be larger. They should have been listed in children's section.",2
303,I like them the only thing it's that is a little bit hard to put them on but they are goid for the price.,4
304,i loved then! Ive been wearing them on and off since i got then and they are by far my favorite pair of earings:-),5
305,Super cute.  Not sure how long before they tarnish but they are worth what I spent for sure.,4
306,"So incredibly tiny. Can't even tell they are flowers, let alone anything but silver circles.",1
307,Arrived broken. Cannot even wear. Don't waste your money.,1
308,"These are really dainty and pretty!  I really like them and will continue buying from here in the future!

Karel",5
309,"May be nickel plated but will stay in day to day.  Really small,  so am I but I think too small like kid size.",4
310,Very small. I can't even get them in my ears and they don't stay closed,2
311,They are very nice.  They have a little weight to it which I don't care for. But doesn't take from the look.,4
312,These earrings are beautiful.  Small and sparkly....very nice.,5
313,I am a repeat customer.  The quality is GREAT!!,5
314,I use this in my diffuser at night and it has really helped my sinuses!,5
315,Company recommended for ethical practices and we really enjoy it.,5
316,Love this soap.  Smells good and doesn't make skin dry.,5
317,Zest fully Zest fully Zest fully clean.... You're not fully clean unless you're Zest fully clean!,5
318,glad to be able to find it at a great price,5
319,"Hate the new curved bar, but I've used zest for 24 years.",3
320,It arrived way earlier than expected! And it smells amazing almost chocolate like.,5
321,Very grainy product. I cannot even imagine using it on my hair. Definitely will NOT purchase again.,1
322,"I love this butter!  Great for DIY hair conditioners, creams and body lotions.  Moisturizing and easy to use!",5
323,Just as described. Very moisturizing for the hair and skin. Overall great product and comapny,5
324,Aroma is comforting.  Used on my 1 year old grandson during a full blown cold.  He seemed to improve rapidly.,5
325,I love this company but not too crazy about this one. It seems that it is not strong enough.,4
326,Great they came in. Handy. Just what i need.,5
327,I must had not read the description well. The size was not what I thought it was so I was disappointed in that. Quality is good,3
328,i loved it came just like how it looks in the picture thanks sm,5
329,This thread is the worst its thick and it bunches up which threading the needle,1
330,Got the product pretty fast using prime. Each one is fairly small but they work fine,5
331,Used one day and the comb broke off... not happy with substandard product...,2
332,Love how it gives the steam. Wish the hood was made of more dense material. It was cheap looking when I got it.,4
333,This is a powerful steamer. The facial steamer feature is better than the hair steamer. I just saved some money on facials :)),4
334,"It came in good time, and it works just like it said it would, Really enjoy steaming my face.",4
335,Well it was cute  but it had a big Crack in the hood..,5
336,Loved it! Did what it was suppose to do. Moisturize!,4
337,This is a knock off brand. I used it 3 times and now it no longer works. Waste of money. Do not buy,2
338,We are send this product back we plugged it up and it does not work,1
339,So far so good.  Everything is as described and worked great the first time.,5
340,"very bad quality, almost got burned .. DONT BUY IT",1
341,"Flimsy construction, but works well so far.  Keeping my fingers and toes crossed for its longevity.",3
342,Didn't work for me but was able to get a refund promptly. I think this is for larger chest ladies!,5
343,"And if you orders in the next 10 minutes, you'll get the Taco Turtle absolutely free!",5
344,I couldn't get it to stay between my 38D boobs- otherwise great idea!,4
345,I use this almost every night now. Tip: it stays in place better if you wear a sports bra. I would buy it again.,5
346,"It cute. However my chest killed this lil bear. If you are above a B, don't waste your money.",1
347,Doesn't work.. since has no straps the bear won't stay in place so it's useless,1
348,Unfortunately my breasts are too large. I'm a 34 G. Doesn't seem to make a difference. Cute but not effective.,3
349,I didn't like this....it didn't stay in place.,2
350,"doesn't work very well ,  it is very small , better use as a baby or dog toy .  better to  just use a pillow",2
351,"Its too wide and i have to keep adjusting it. But, it is very soft and plush.",3
352,I've been dealing with sweaty uncomfortable boobs forever and titty bear is the breast!!!!,5
353,Helps to have a shirt or tank top on while sleeping.,4
354,Its good but I'm 36D and it was too small for me .,3
355,I have a large chest and this does not stay in place at all. Not worth the money!,1
356,"Good. The button before head is kind of loose, but worth the price",4
357,i used my 2 other hair towels as cleaning rags..perfect hair microfiber towel,5
358,"Excellent product used by my wife. It arrived quickly and in good condition.
Easily recommended by this family.",5
359,Very comfortable and block the light.  Glad I found these!,5
360,Bought these as gifts and they were really pleased with the diffuser.  They haven't tried the car one yet.,4
361,Excellent diffuser...I have 4 now so I don't have to relocate throughout the house.,5
362,"car diffuser doesn't work at all.  One of my room diffusers works, the other doesn't :(",2
363,Love having safe oils to diffuse in our cars! Thanks!!,5
364,Got here 10 days earlier than expected! I am absolutely in love with this product.,5
365,"Diffuser works great, the car diffuser is so so.",3
366,Love how my face feels after I use this.  Keeps my chin acne free.,5
367,REALLY NICE GIFT SET. SMELL LOVELY AND ARE A PLEASURE! I I GOT A DISCOUNT FOR MY REVIEW :),5
368,This was a gift for my mom and she loved it!,5
369,"Only bombs I must have besides my favorites at Lush. These are fantastic, no ring around the tub, relaxing and packaged beautifully!",5
370,Absolutely love these. I've bought many for myself and gifts. They leave your skin very soft and they smell great!,5
371,Very nice lotion. I will update if I get results,4
372,Did not like the smell. Packaged great. You have to come directly home after tanning due to it leaves a nasty after smell,3
373,"Bought two, both were missing their clear caps. One was leaking in the package but still usable. Fast shipping.",4
374,"Bottle came broken on top, lotion was spilled entirely in package, very runny what was left of it. Disappointed",2
375,Exactly what I was looking for and much cheaper than in the tanning salon!! Thanks!,5
376,This didn't help my skin with blemishes and it dried it out.,2
377,"So far so good, but I am not sure it really works to lighten my age spots.",4
378,This has worked wonderful for skin texture in my t-zone area and doesn't irritate my under eyes!,5
379,Works good but I think I need something a little stronger for my congested skin,3
380,Within a week my skin became much clearer and softer. Doesn't make my skin red and irritated like some retinol products do.,5
381,"This actually is working! My skin looks clearer, smoother, and my fine lines are diminished. No burning or peeling. Will def buy more.",4
382,Good product!! I use it under a moisturizing night cream. Appears to significantly improve the texture of my skin.,4
383,"still trying item out , brought it cause they said it clears blemishes.",3
384,Its OK .... Didn't see any results that people were raving about .,1
385,Have several acne on my face and this soap is amazing my free acne and dark spots.,5
386,Arrived fast but i don't think this product is for me/ my skin type,3
387,Not sure yet. Maybe too soon to see results. Great flavor though.,3
388,"It was easy to shave and melt.
Has been perfect for my skin and is fresh!",5
389,High quality cocoa butter.  Smells divine!  Great product.,5
390,Product is exactly as listed. It does have a strong cocoa smell however and some others do not.,5
391,I really like the product. I did not like the way it was packaged.,4
392,"Smells wonderful, moisturizers very well. Overall amazing product!!!",5
393,I've been very pleased with the quality of this product.  All the lotions and potions I've used it in have turned out great!,5
394,"Ordered this product more than once, and will continue buying it.  Great quality, great smell...good price!",5
395,Pure and authentic. Smells WONDERFUL and provides the expected quality I was looking for.,5
396,"This is the best! Melts fast and leaves your skin moist for the day! The smell is awesome but not overpowering.
Great Buy",5
397,"I love it, love it, love it! I love the way it smells mixed with my body washes I use for bathing.",5
398,The product arrived quickly and intact.  Smelled wonderful and mixed very well with my shea butter.,5
399,Way too big for a six. No screen protector.,1
400,I love it but I put it on wrong. It's cute tho.,5
401,Nice product ' it do ware down after about 2 weeks.,5
402,This is my favorite decal glitter for my 6 plus. I have like every color ,5
403,It's nice. But top has some brown in it. I was wanting all blond. Great seller!! Kind! Responds! Thank You,5
404,The item that came in the mail had off sized wefts and wasn't like the picture,1
405,"it shows on the manique one length, but it is shorter in back than front
otherwise, great wig!",5
406,"Great color and texture.
I would buy this again.",5
407,love this it works fantasicly if u have no hair and isn't itchy like most wigs,5
408,This is such a cute wig. You can't beat this quality for such a low price.,5
409,"Nice wig, but far shorter than the picture depicts. I returned this item.",2
410,"For the price, this is a great wig. The color is nice and the texture is almost believable.",5
411,Perfect for cross dressing my husband! The guy on her date loved it!,5
412,"It looks and feels super fake!
Not what i expected!!",1
413,Pretty cool. Fairly realistic looking. You do have to have a certain face for it - it didn't work for me.,4
414,Wrong wig. Was short and blonde not the one in photo,1
415,"The weft in the front part is bulky, visible, and very hard to hide",2
416,The wig I got was not the one in the picture. It is a short bob style.,1
417,Great wig!! I've received many compliments!!,5
418,My hair feels so much better!. After the first treatment i could tell a huge change. So soft and in control! Great product! .,5
419,"In the photo, the necklace looks thin and small, but the real one is bigger. If it were thin, it would look sexier.",5
420,It is tiny! It also broke the first time I put it on!,1
421,"very nice to wear on a casual outing, will keep.",4
422,piece of garbage - it broke the first few hours i was wearing it,1
423,"The chain is cute, but it's not what I ordered. I ordered Gold and I received Silver.",3
424,"Nice product, but is much entangled . Fast delivery.",4
425,I wore it for a day and next day it was all rusted wouldn't recommend.,1
426,This is that awful $ .25 machine gold color. I wish it wasn't- besides the terrible color it's super cute!,2
427,I ordered this for a 3 day trip to Vegas...which was all it lasted before falling apart. It is cute though.,2
428,"I like it n is very nice,it came on scheduled date",4
429,Love it!! Looks better in person then in the picture! Received sooner then expected delivery date,5
430,"came in earlier than stated, it's beautiful, but the necklace is actually long.",4
431,You will find dozens of practical uses for this product.,5
432,Was a lot of packaging for such a small box. But it works as expected!,5
433,Not very secure at least for the use I was attempting which was securing dress straps.,2
434,Not what I thought it was. Very expensive for 36 small strips. Hollywood Fashion Tape is a much better deal.,1
435,"I used this to hem a gauzy curtain I hung at the side of my daughter's bed, and it worked really well!",5
436,Works with lighter weight clothing but not as well on heavier fabrics or ones with texture.,3
437,Used on the bride and bridesmaids for a wedding.  Great for all around female usage in holding all the formal crap together.,5
438,I found that the adhesive did not hold as advertised. It is just okay.,3
439,For the price is a beautiful organizer. The color is great. I will buy it again.,4
440,I received this from a friend and it's very pretty. Love the mint green color.,5
441,Was supposed to receive all three of the stencil products only got the green one stop need the blue and red,5
442,"I love it, shipping was fast too! great.",5
443,"Great follow up to the shampoo, conditions without leaving my fine hair limp. Smells nice too.",4
444,I absolutely love these pens! They are perfect for creating fine lines and details.,5
445,"I haven't used all of them yet, but the ones I have used are nice.",5
446,These came packaged great. They were the perfect starter size. I would buy again,5
447,love it!!!!!! I use it to make different types of face masks and cleansers,5
448,Thanks to other reviews I knew what to expect. They are vibrant colors. Minamal bleed through if pressing hard. Normal/soft writing will not bleed through.,5
449,These are larger than I expected I bought them as a gift.  Very happy with the purchase.,5
450,So far so good! The bottles are a good size !,5
451,"I am so happy with this oils gift set. It arriveed on time, very nice packing, and absolutely I am going to order it again.",5
452,"Love this product, it is light and does not feel oily.",5
453,"I have sensitive skin, and this product does not irritate it. I tried a single bar initially, and decided to buy the 3 pack.",5
454,Great pack of carrier oils. Exactly what I was hoping for.,5
455,"No complaints. Fineliner Pens work well . Great assortment of colors and would rebuy again and again. Will recommend to friends,  family and colleagues.",5
456,Very elegant fine tip pens. Great quality! Color pigments are exactly as pictured. I definitely recommend this product!,5
457,"Beautiful set of carrier oils!  And packaged quite well.  This set is for myself, but this would be a great gift to give, also!",5
458,"Great Product, high quality pens. My kids love them. Great customer communication and experience.",5
459,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GPTP2G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
I like my first order, so I order again. Was easy and fast delivery.",5
460,"Excellent, got pens quickly. Very high quality for school and work projects.
Great color!!!
Will buy product again.",5
461,The pens received exceeds my expectation!  Translates my motions smoothly on paper.  I would definitely buy these again.,5
462,Exactly what I was looking for! I will definitely buy again,5
463,"I don't usually watch TV, but everyone else has it for me and I sell it. The antenna is ok",5
464,"This antenna is very new. I like it very much. Thank you amazon, thank you",5
465,"The product is very good, the assembly can be used, really as described, can get a lot of channels",5
466,"Excellent quality and reasonable price, which is definitely the nicest antenna I've ever used, and it works well, and it's worth buying",5
467,"I installed it very simple, and then the search channel works well, thanks to the seller",5
468,"Simple installation, special liking, love death, good work effect, worthy of recommendation",5
469,"I live in a remote area, and I'm glad that the antenna works properly",5
470,This product has brought my TV back to work. It really works,5
471,"The things are good, the logistics is fast, there is nothing to be choosy about",5
472,"Overall I'm please with my purchase and would highly recommended this antenna, its works as it should its a simple design and great quality.",5
473,Due to the bigger antenna and amplifier this therefore means that you will get a much stronger signal from the broadcast provider.,5
474,This antenna is just about as thin as a a4 paper. Built in this antenna has signal amplified and long distance connection.,5
475,"Works perfectly first time. Amazing. Glad I bought it. Would recommend to anyone. Signal is fantastic and there is no fuss with connection,",5
476,"Love the way this soap makes your skin feel, soft and clean. Good smell as well.",5
477,"Very nice, I use it as a bath soap as well as a facial soap.",5
478,Leave your skin soft. Really like this soap will be buying again.,5
479,I love this stuff it feels great and leaves my shin super soft and hydrated while still removing dead skin.,5
480,"it leaves my fave squeaky clean, skin is soft and smells delicioso! i little pricey but still like it.",5
481,"Smells okay, but I was expecting it to smell more like coconut. Very perfumey.",4
482,Didn't work and plus the crystal didn't work.,1
483,Favorite belly bottom I've ever got! I like the way it looks. Super cute,4
484,"Super cute, price can't be beat.  Arrived considerably before expected.",5
485,These necklaces are stylish & cute. I'll be wearing them frequently for sure.,5
486,It looks much better in person! Both the necklaces were intact and were quite large. My friend loved it.,5
487,Bought it because a dentist had recommended. It met my expectations I had never felt my teeth this clean.,5
488,"Tube of paste is very small, taste is not good. Left my mouth feeling unclean compared to my normal routine.",1
489,It does the job - fills in sensitive spots.  I was surprised to see artificial favors in ingredients.  Missed that when searching.,4
490,Love carifree have their number and love their toothpaste and mouthwash...love that it's not hard on ur teeth and feels fresh and clean,5
491,very soft & works great! only giving it 4 stars because the way it's supposed to wrap around your head is not intuitive.,4
492,"Very absorbent. Was hoping it would be a little longer (for thick, long hair). Still works a lot better than the Turbie Twist.",4
493,This was perfect for my daughter who has long thick hair!!!!,5
494,I LOVED THIS! simple. Keeps hair hydrated and tamed while getting ready or applying makeup! MUST BUY FOR ALL HAIR TYPES!,4
495,"works great for thin hair, might not for thick-long hair.  But it is great",5
496,Works great for my long hair. It is very absorbent.,5
497,"This is pretty big , the loop is way to small and is really hard to get the  button around it.",1
498,These didn't dry out for me. They soon smelled sour. Nice otherwise,2
499,"Perfect, fluffy & absorbant. I use one of these every day. Washes well.",5
500,"Too too fluffy, the loop to hook around button broke in first week.",2
501,"Stylish, stays in place and even slept in it on lazy nights :-)",5
502,Great product and does the job! Now my daughter's hair can dry faster before bedtime without the hair dryer!,5
503,I love this towel. I am going to buy myself another one and a few more as gifts.,5
504,"Good adsorption gets the wetness out of the hair, comes in different colors and stays secure",5
505,Super plush. Do wish it had a stretchy strap though.,4
506,this is also good for sleeping in when you get up dry hair  or for conditioning your hair,5
507,Bought this for my 10-year old daughter. Wish it had an elastic attachment instead of the button to make it easier for her to twist and secure.,3
508,This is a great item.  Hair seems to dry much faster when I use this.,5
509,Works wonderful. Stays on well and makes you hair feel soft.,5
510,Works great - could be just a touch larger (and I have a very small head). But definitely gets the job done!,4
511,"Works great for my daughters thick curly hair, although it's a little tight fitting for her, even at 7yrs old.",4
512,Super soft and absorbent. Gave it to my mom to use at the gym and she loves it.,5
513,I like it & won't use a regular towel on my hair any more.,4
514,I bought this for my granddaughter. She loves it. It's very soft,5
515,Works so much better than trying to keep a towel wrapped on your head.,5
516,It does not hold all of my hair and the button/string is very hard to use. An elastic one works much better.,1
517,It's okay but I think the Aquis turban fits better because it has elasticized sides.,3
518,I love this for my hair. It works a lot better than using a towel for your hair. I highly recommend this product,5
519,Bought this for my daughter who has naturally curly hair - she could not get all of her hair under this towel.  She has too much hair,1
520,Doesn't really soak up the water like I would have thought it would.,3
521,These tiles perform very well for drying hair. They even work with long thick hair,5
522,Loved the microfiber but I have short hair and it is more difficult to wrap securely around my head.  Better for long hair.,4
523,"Yes, I purchased for my granddaughter and myself. We love them.",5
524,"Broke in the first day, had to sew the loop that goes over the button. Works ok other than that.",3
525,"Save your money.....a towel works just as well......in fact, even better",1
526,Very absorbent & I think it is larger than others I looked at.,4
527,"This was a gift, but I use mine all the time",4
528,Works well at drying my super thick curly hair.  Very soft and quite absorbent.,5
529,Very very cheap feeling and looking...but even worse the bbutton is WAY to big for the loop. I'm gonna have to change buttons!,1
530,I like it. Control oil and does minimise my pores though only slightly.,4
531,I love this stuff.  It smooths your skin just nicely and I use a tinted foundation over it.,5
532,"Love this product, makes my skin fell so soft and blends well with my other makeup.",5
533,Great primer before putting on my makeup. Glad to find a smaller tube for travel.,5
534,"Really small tube. Not worth it, does not blur. All that well either.",1
535,"Although I have oily skin and it does not combat the oil, it works well covering large pores!",4
536,"I love the product, but I did not realize .5 is really small for the money.",4
537,works great under foundation to smooth lines and hide large pores.,5
538,Love this stuff but this was the sample size for the price of the regular size.  It should clarify the size in the description.,1
539,Been using for years...love it. Skin feels like silk and a little goes a long way,5
540,"Wow, I am surprised how much I like this product!!!  I saw it on an online tutorial and loved it!",5
541,"This is one of my favorite beauty items. I'm giving it 3 stars because I didn't know it was ""trial"" size.",3
542,"This stuff is great, if you have old skin, it covers the pours and inprofections",5
543,This stuff really works and at a fraction of the price of other products that claim to do the same thing. Almost looks like airbrushing.,4
544,Change your picture! I was expecting 2 tubes- as shown.,2
545,I like it . It helps minimize my pores. You just have to re-apply since it doesn't hold all day.,4
546,This product is very clumpy. I just use it for a moisturizer until I run out,2
547,"Enh, this primer does nothing for me unfortunately. It didn't blur anything, but it has a nice finish.",2
548,"Works great, wouldn't call it a miracle though and is a bit oily feeling",4
549,"Not impressed. The tube is super small, and it does not do magic.",1
550,"This product makes your face smooth but it is not a concealer so your spots are still there. Still, five stars for what it can do.",5
551,Won't stay in my hair or even a wig that a bought. Doesn't look real and looks more like cow ears than cats.,1
552,"Super cute,  they don't stay in hair very well.  Good quality.",3
553,Great accessory. Too big for a toddler but otherwise great!,4
554,Ears flop down too much. Look more like puppy ears than cat ears,2
555,The clips are difficult to use and align with they should have just been put on the headband,3
556,Well made and soft material. Stays in fine hair easily and doesn't slide out.,5
557,"Fluffy, furry, and perfect fit. They went very well with the tail I ordered and I'll get them again if these wear out!",5
558,Bought these for my son for Christmas.  He LOVES them!,4
559,I really thought these would be like a head band or something but no they are little berretts and look really cute,5
560,My daughter loves them and was a good addition to her costume,5
561,I bought the cat ears for Halloween and for a party and everyone loved it and it looked pretty close to anime cat ears,5
562,"I thought they would be easy to put in, I was proved wrong",1
563,"These look terrible on your head, plus they are comfortable and do not secure to your head.",1
564,They reauire bobby pins to keep positioned but are super cute and comfy.,4
565,It was in good condition and it's exactly what I expected from the item,5
566,Every time I put them in my hair they just flop over.,2
567,Super easy to clip on and extremely soft! I bought this along with a matching tail and the combination was puuuuuuurrrfect :),5
568,They are good but they feel cheaply built. Still for the price not bad,3
569,Hard to keep in my hair. I'll experiment on ways to keep them in. But they're really cute,3
570,My daughter likes them as they do not have a head band.,4
571,"Amazing soft comfortable ears that stay on, tho I would recommend they add another clip to the ears so they don't wabble around.",5
572,so kawaii! im now a cute lil kitty cat! :3,5
573,"I really love these ears,and they shipped pretty quickly",5
574,"The only issue I've found is that the clips can be a bit of a hassle sometimes. Other than that, they are great.",5
575,These are super cute and now I want them in every color scheme =D,5
576,The ears are really small and one ear doesn't even have a clip.. I can't even use these.,1
577,I love the feel and the color but the clips on the ears are not that stable. Other than that it looks awesome thanks!,3
578,OMG my little girl wears them every where.. She now has a fox tail and now ears..She look so cutie as my little fox,5
579,Super adorable and easy to clip on. I love them. And they are super soft!!!,5
580,It's hard to keep the ears in the right place but it's worth it.,4
581,Good product! Easier on your skin than Panoxyl bar soap,5
582,"I ordered this set, and the products are great to use, for every day care.",5
583,I love this smell! And my skin feels so soft.,5
584,No travel sizes here!!! Great gift set!!!,5
585,"This mask is awesome, trendy and keep me warm. It has a weird smell though, but after awhile the smell goes away.",5

627,Love love love. What a great color and it has somewhat of a sweet smell.,5
628,This gloss required me to put on 5 layers before it showed up. It stayed on for about 3 mins.,1
629,Chapped my lips for some reason. To each is own.,2
630,It comes off very easily and the colors is very very light. I would use it on top of a lipstick but its not sufficient by itself.,3

646,It's really relaxing to roll my face after skincare. Helps with puffiness too. Would recommend.,4
647,They were broken before I even opened the box and clearly cheaply made. Do not waste your money.,1
648,Stone fell off after a few uses and also made a lot of noise. Unfortunate cause I liked the sensation on my face,1
649,"So i like the product, but know that this is only ONE roller, the picture makes it seem like it is two.",3
650,Feels nice and cool against my face.  Not sure yet if it is improving my skin tone at all.,5

662,It broke after about 2 weeks and it's not real jade,1
663,item has a crack in the big roller but it didn't cost much so i didn't bother to return. more yellow colored jade than green.,2

681,I like it and all just made my skin way to oily,4
682,Didn't love it. Smelled a little funny and left my skin feeling oily. Won't be purchasing again.,2

1182,Only worked for about 2 weeks.  The motor just quit. I sent it back - you get what you pay for.,1
1183,Purchased this for my 11 year old daughter to help with her changing skin.  Within a week her skin was much clearer.,5

1203,"Love that there are separate parts, very good match, good price, realistic",5

1450,Good hold.  Hair feeks sticky. Needed to add quite a bit of water to get it to a  usable consistency,3
1451,Great product works great on my son's very thick hair.  Smells good too.,5
1452,This works nice. The scent is also good. Will stick to this brand.,5
1453,Doesn't flake and smells good.give it a try I'm sure you would be happy.,5
1454,Best pomade I've ever tried. No product build up/flakes. Gives a sleek finish and lasts days before another application is needed!!!,5
1455,"It straightens my hair, but it also does pull it's a little more harsh than a normal hair brush",3
1456,"Hard on the head, brush part breaks easily, does the job but takes forever because it's not smooth on brushed hair.",1
1457,"Did not do a good job, pulled hair.. daughter wasn't even a fan. I had high hopes since I have fairly thin, wavy/curly hair.. disappointed..",1
1458,I didn't like it at all my hair it's very fine and even so never look nice and sleeker,1
1459,The brush did not get hot enough to straighten the hair.,2
1460,"This is ok, but as the reviews says the buttons are hard to miss along the side.  Also It doesn't straighten shorter hair.",2
1461,Dislike. I'm afraid to use it. I didn't see any US stamp of electrical safety on it.,1
1462,Love it! Bought it for my daughter very very coil hair it was straight in seconds.,5
1463,It was okay should have purchased a different brand not the results I was expecting,3
1464,"I am sending it back
My hair dresser said it is not good for my curly hair!",1
1465,It did not work well for me. I will stick with my flat iron.,1
1466,Very award to use a does not straighten as well as a flatiron and makes my hair frizzy. Would not recommend.,2
1467,Difficulties setting up the right temperature is the only problem I encountered.  You actually need a protective glove due to the amount of heat generated.,3
1468,Works good but doesn't get as hot as a straightener fast delivery over all I'm happy .great if your in a hurry,4
1469,Not at all what I was expecting. Was not easy to use and didn't straighten my hair like my flat iron does.  Returning this.,1
1470,"Works well on black hair, no need for anything else.",5
1471,Way better then I thought! Easy to use and does the job!,4

It pulled my hair as i brushed",1

1483,"Got it for my wife for christmas & she still thanks me. Heats up quick, works great!",5

1489,"I have coarse hair and it worked ok, but it took a lot of brushing and letting the brush reheating.",3
1490,"Loved it. Its easy to use, heats up fast and works great",5

1571,Just started to use the Genesea night cream for a few weeks and it's work nice. I have seen improvement,5
1572,It is a very good product wish they had a day cream for younger women.,5
1573,"Genesea is a wonderful product: it gives my skin a necessary nourishment, smoothness & rejuvenation. Irena A.",5
1574,Not too scented and absorbs well.  I appreciate that it doesn't have a strong perfume scent.  Seems to be doing some smoothing of the skin.,5
1575,I was skeptical at the beginning but it works. My skin is getting much better and my husband has also noticed.,5
1576,did not notice any different after I apply on my face. very disapointed.,1

1596,I have been using it for a few weeks now.  I love it. It's been cold and dry and my skin stayed moisturized.,5
1597,"Just started using it, but love the smell and how smooth it goes on.",4
1598,Easy to fill; be careful that you don't lose the little fitting in the bottom. Works as well as expensive ones!,5
1599,Great 'lil brush. Combo pure badger plus boar. Lovely handle. Lathers big.  Bargain!  Takes 15 uses or so to break in.,5
1600,This is a great travel brush. It works very well with hard soaps and croaps. Def not a brush to over look,5
1601,"Super cute design, but extremely hard to bend in order to get a nice snug fit.",3
1602,Do not buy this.. Looks nothing like the picture. Cant even tell its a snake.. Just a piece of metal that doesnt even fit on your ear.,1
1603,Does not even have enough metal to hook or stay on an ear lobe. Non-functioning design. Total waste. Don't buy.,1
1604,waste of money. do not buy. it doesn't even wrap around because its so small,1
1605,Fits perfectly and looks fantastic. So glad I ordered this!,5
1606,Poorly made broke same day we received it!! Garbage!!!!,1
1607,Have to make adjustments as the fit is not right. Not as nice as pictured.,3
1608,This s*** is ugly fake and doesnt look nothing like the picture cant bend or make it fit at all bad choice to invest in suck suck suck suck,1
1609,"Lasted longer then expected, got a lot of compliments.",5
1610,My daughter got these for herself and they didn't last a few hours before they peeled off.,1
1611,Adorable anime-style ears! Easy to attach to wig or hair with comfortable clips. Well-made. Hoping it is faux fur....,5
1612,Reaaally lovely!!! Used these for my daughters Unicorn costume for Halloween! They are perfect!!!,5
1613,They are great got them in a week and clips are not cheap like I thought they would be love them!,5
1614,Not the best quality but you get what you pay for and its not terrible. <3,4
1615,"Incredibly soft and durable material,  came with clips and a band so you can choose how to wear them.  Arrived quickly and safely packaged.",5
1616,Super kawaii and suuuuper fluffy! I need the black pair now,5
1617,Super cute! I bought these to wear with my unicorn costume and they will be very versatile for many things!,5
1618,Only down side is that your hairncant be down to wear them properly if you have straight fine hair.,4
1619,My daughter loved them and they were a great price.,5
1620,They are very very soft and hold up pretty well like they aren't difficult to work at all! I love to use them for my Jade harley,4
1621,I used these to attach to my wig for halloween. I got a lot of compliments. Very cute.,5
1622,Worked great for my costume.they were super soft and cute! The shipping was fast and it came the next day,5
1623,"They were bigger than I expected and very cute. My daughter attached them to a wig and wore them to Comicon , they stayed on all day .",5
1624,"The ears are soft and cute!
Ive clipped them onto a wig and also my real hair and they work on both.",5
1625,Sadly not the best design. You get what you paid for.,2
1626,they don't exactly look like cat ears when on.. way too triangularly shaped.. just rather awkward.,2
1627,"Worked great for my Halloween costume, the clips are removable.",5
1628,Very difficult to get the ears to stay in hair but they're very cute and I made them work.,4
1629,"They stay in your hair better if it's curly, but a couple bobby pins help keep it in place. I love em",4
1630,"they are so cute! But not for me, so I gave them to my little sister, she LOves them!",5
1631,Amazing cat ears. Clip holds onto my hair all day and they are soooo soft!!! Great product!!!,5
1632,Cute and sturdy. The product was delivered earlier than expected,4
1633,Cute. Bigger than I expected them to be. Kind of hard for my 4 year old to keep on her head but she likes them.,4
1634,"Just what my daughter was looking for.  Snap Barrett closures., no headband to make your head hurt",5
1635,Had to buy a second pair for my sister because she liked mine so much!,5
1636,Absolutely adorable. These are the best cat ears ever. The clip works great and kept them on all night.,5
1637,"Completely adorable! I wish the clips were easier to situate but after a bit of fiddling, its completely worth it!",5
1638,So cute and fluffy! can't wait to wear them for my Carla cosplay ^_^,5
1639,"There good ears , very nice but they do tend to flop a little and the clips do suck a little but other than that then there good",4
1640,I had to play with them for an hour because they were so floppy but it worked out just fine for my Kyubey cosplay,3
1641,They're great! Good quality! Just a bit more scruffy than I imagined. But still a great purchase!:),4
1642,Great for what they're needed for. Super easy to clip in and they don't fall out.,5
1643,Just fluff up a little when you recieve it and it stays in place! Got the correct color i wanted (white with pink inside),5
1644,Very cute. They look just like the picture. But they are kind of hard to keep in place.,5
1645,These are so cute and soft! The clips are perfect and easily hold in hair.,5
1646,"Awesome! Cute and shipped fast. A little awkward figuring out the best way to clip them, but they're great.",5
1647,"They are clips they don't stay in my hair very well, but look adorable",5
1648,"Flimsy and all white, not like the photo.  The clips are cruddy.",1
1649,I these so much! I wear them out and about on a semi regular basis and they've held up great! Will buy again!,5
1650,"They are wonderful!!! I love how they clip into your hair, and actually stay in place. Wonderful quality.",5
1651,they are so cute and soft ill be sure to buy another pair once mines wear out,5
1652,came fast! love it! great seller thanks!!,5
1653,This product works well to protect the clothes of our clients during treatments. It washes easily and looks nice. I would purchase another.,4
1654,"works great.  definitely a cheaper material than what they use at professional salons, but it gets the job done.",5
1655,"Short on the back side and kind of thin, but it works",4
1656,Very nice quality!!! I am very happy with them!,5
1657,It works great!  It's not as thick as the ones in the hair salons but it's just as effective.,5
1658,Great cape. Wish I would have found it sooner!,5
1659,Capes are what they said. Light weight and comfortable.,5
1660,Washes well. Quality upholds. Definitely not waterproof. Bleach resistant.,4
1661,Does a great job keeping hair off my husband and kids when I cut their hair,5
1662,"Thin, but for the price they were exactly as I expected.",5
1663,"I'm so glad I bought this, works great on my kids (2 & 4 yrs old) and my husband. Highly recommend!",5
1664,I got this to give haircuts to kids at home but cleaning this very tedious,1
1665,I don't see a difference between this cape and a $25-$30 cape except the savings,5
1666,Worked great.. so much easier than using a towel! Snapped/unsnapped easily and the hair just came right off.,5
1667,Had for a while now. Seems durable (no broken snaps). Hair doesn't stick. Light weight,4
1668,I love it! It fits beautifully on my little boy and my husband....very adaptable.,5
1669,Works so much better than trying to keep a bulky towel in place.,5
1670,Totally durable & has a thick feel.  Snaps & unsnaps smoothly.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,5
1671,Works great. Easy to use and fits broad shoulders.,5
1672,"Great cheap cape. It might not hold up in a salon, but for the occasional home use, it's great.",5
1673,Works perfectly every time. Neck is adjustable to fit any size. Definitely a must for those do-it-yourself hair gurus or professional ones too.,5
1674,Great!! I dye my own hair. This cape protects my skin and clothes from getting dye everywhere.,4
1675,Works really well.  Is quite large but I suppose that's good :),5
1676,Good size and thickness. Only issue is that it's difficult to clean the hair off of it (they stick to it very well).,3
1677,Perfect capes for styling.  Exactly as described.  They are a satin material so they move easily and keep your clients from becoming too hot.,5
1678,Works great for both my husband and 3 year old!,5
1679,Cheap material but the hair don't stick to it and the closing has been working good after 6 month of use,4
1680,Serves its purpose. Wish it wasn't so short in the back,4
1681,Its a typical cape. Its thicker than I thought for such a low price,5
1682,"Great size. Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Not heavy, good quality.",5
1683,Too short in the back and too long in the front,1
1684,"Works well for giving haircuts at home. It does what it is designed for, would recommend for basic haircutting needs.",5
1685,Cape is waterproof but the back is shorter than expected.,3
1686,Nice cape. But wish it were a little more water repellent,3
1687,Caution! Do not wash this with anything else (including dark towels) because the black will bleed over everything. Went right in the trash.,1
1688,I love my capes and they were delivered on time! They are exactly what i wanted.,5
1689,"I love this, and so do the guys in family. Wish I bought sooner!",5
1690,"Very good for haircuts, not waterproof but very comfortable, light and airy. The snaps are great.",4
1691,Love it!  It fits perfectly around my husbands neck!,5
1692,Good quality and lots of snaps to fit the entire family.,5
1693,Works great for cutting my aging mother's hair at home. Recommend.,5
1694,Worked good but the smallest button would not latch. I bought to use on my toddler so I had to use a pin instead.,4
1695,better than i thought it would be for the mone y large and covers good,5
1696,cape is what it is shown to be. Its bigger than I thought but thats ok,4
1697,Works well and is large enough for a person sitting in a wheel chair.,4
1698,Worked well but have to wonder how long the plastic snaps will last.,4
1699,Works great and really saves on the clean up. Fits my husband and 3yo great lots of adjustment options,5
1700,It does not snap well around the neck. I would not recommend the product.,3
1701,"I was a little surprised at how lightweight it is, but it does the job.",4
1702,Works just what you need it for. Came quickly.,5
1703,This is just what I needed. Simple snaps and will fit different sizes.,5
1704,"Works great. Neck snaps close enough to fit all sizes, and easy to clean after a haircut; just shake it out.",5
1705,My husband loves not having hair all over him from his haircuts. He says it feels comfortable around the neck.,5
1706,"Soooo, all the snaps are male snaps.  Probably just a defect but whatever.",1
1707,"The hair slides right off of it, and it fastens nicely around the neck for a good clean cut without hair down your neck.",5
1708,Great replacement for our old cape...this is a flexible lightweight material.,5
1709,Love it. It is soft and great size!!!,5
1710,It would be better if it were longer in the back.,3
1711,"Very big, plenty buttons for the neck, wraps around the back of the shoulder enough for me.",5
1712,Very nice. Covers the whole body and plenty of snaps to extend the neck coverage.,5
1713,It closes on my neck and keeps the hairs from falling into itchy places. Plenty of size adjustability too. Does the trick.,4
1714,Came on time and looks just like the pic. Very nice cape.,5
1715,"Keeps the hair off good, but the hair seems to stick to it after the hair cut in spite of vigorous shaking.",3
1716,"Great for the price. As someone else mentioned, the back is not long at all. Works fine for sitting down while cutting hair.",5
1717,Works nice and I always needed one of these.  Daughter loves it to get her hair washed.,5
1718,Much improved my experience cutting my kids' hair!  The snaps adjust the neck opening and it goes small enough for my 5 year-old.,5
1719,"This works very well for me.  Lightweight but durable.  It's not waterproof, but I'm only using it as a shield for trimming hair.",4
1720,Super fast delivery.  Just bought a 2nd one because we like it so well. Thanks,5
1721,The cape is fine. I just hate how the hair static clings to it and so I don't feel like it is clean to put away.,4
1722,it does not cover the back and defeats the purpose.,1

1774,Product is okay.  I find the need to use it repeatedly to get cracked skin on heels off.,3
1775,The smell....that's all I have to say. Especially since I work in the ER. I really enjoy putting this on my hands,5
1776,This is a sheer light non greasy lotion and it smells fresh not over powering especially for the summer .,5

1794,"Perfect unisex deodorant for my fiance and I.  Note, make sure your armpits are dry for a more even application.",5
1795,Hated the smell and the sticky feel.  Plus it didn't have any antiperspirant q,1

1812,It gave me a bad rash will never use again to bad i love organic this has never happen to me with anything organic before.,2

1821,"Super cute, but did not stay on as long as the Jamberry's do.",3
1822,Pattern was cute and nice that they came with the application but they literally lasted 2 hours if that. The adhesive needs work for sure!,1

1825,Does not work on my skin. It's really thick and hard to apply. It also breaks me out.,3
1826,It's very thick and rich.  Very small for the price.  Feels really good on your skin.,3
1827,I had an issue with shipping but the company corrected it fast.  It's a little thick but other than that it's great.,3
1828,"Really recommend this for use it at night. You can feel the different next morning.
Just the size is smaller than I thought.  :)",4
1829,You get what you pay for. Cheapest zipper will not close all the way.,2

1872,I would love it but it broke a little around the back. Luckily my mom fixed it before it got too bad. Still cute though,4
1873,"The choker stretches and should be able to fit any size neck, also it came in the mail eariler than expected, would definitely buy again!",5
1874,"Great product. Only issue is the charm, which at times feels like it's too big for the choker itself.",5

2106,I just can't say enough how I love this brand!,5
2107,I  am always delighted with ELF  products good pricing.. too!,5

2120,It is so unbelievably soft and elegant!!!!! LOVED IT FOR MY BRIDE,5
2121,The quality is not what I expected in that the description makes a better product than it is.,2
2122,I didn't receive the stand. I ONLY got the bowl.,1
2123,"shaver bracket holds skinny handled razors, not fat handled shavers like mine.",3
2124,"I have owned this for 2 years and it has held up well, it neat & clean.cleans up well & looks great.
Great price & product.",5
2125,the product is just ok. looks cheap. was bent out of shape when delivered had to reshape.,3
2126,Good holder for brush and soap. Bathroom counter looks organized. Wish the opening for the razor was larger to fit my razor (butterfly razor).,4
2127,"Cup is rather small, had to cut my puck in quarters",3
2128,Shipping was great. Bowl is SMALL! Whole thing OK for the money. Razor holder too small for today's razors.,3
2129,"I sometimes have to travel to do a facial. This steamer is light, easy to use.",5
2130,It's small at works just as well as the big facial steamer does.  Came on time in great packaging,5
2131,This little steamer has a lot of power and the steam reaches a far distant. This is by far the best table steamer I have used.,5
2132,Big one works great haven't tried others yet...but far better than other brands,5
2133,"The stampers are perfect, i'm happy with the purchase.",5
2134,Squishy stamper didn't work for me. The other 2 small ones work great!,4
2135,I did not use before I returned so I cannot review the product. I returned because I did not want a sponge made in China,2
2136,Blends makeup wonderfully. There are no streaks and finish looks natural. Why pay more for a sponge when this does the job?,5
2137,Great  product..  Works; the same as much pricier blender sponges.,5

2143,With this the foundation will spread very smoothly. I love it.,5
2144,I love this!  Your makeup looks so smooth. No streaks.,5
2145,I must say these sponges love my skin and I love them they blend my makeup with little effort,5
2146,I've never used one of these sponges before and wow what a difference it makes!  Love it.,5
2147,I don't use it yself but my finace seems to like it.. so that is okay for me.,4
2148,"I use this thru every step of my beauty regimen, from lotion & serum to mineral foundation & I couldn't be happier.",5
2149,"Good product. It's a little small for my liking, but does the job well and great value for the price! Will certainly purchase again.",4
2150,Wouldn't trade it! I use it every day!!,5
2151,Glides on nicely but has a tendency to smudge when the weather is warm. I'm wondering if it needs setting powder?,4
2152,This is  a  great gel liner I love it  and  I suck at putting on make up big time  this was so easy,5
2153,Works well. Doesn't smudge. Can get a little dry.,4
2154,Worth the money. Harder to use than Bobbi Brown.,4
2155,"This product is Great! Good texture and consistency. The best for a perfect defined winged eye and its Organic, Vegan & Gluten Free!",5
2156,It's a bit dry and not smooth when it goes on. I sometimes add a bit of mineral oil to make it easier.,2
2157,I originally gave this 5 stars but I just had to throw it away because it dried out. The product was stored correctly.,1
2158,Not hypoallergenic.  Castor Oil is an ingredient many are allergic to..,1
2159,Good eyeliner. Goes on smoothly and very black. Removes easily with makeup remover.,4
2160,This lasts much better than any form of eyeliner I have used in the past. So far I am pleased.,5
2161,"I've never tried this eyeliner.
I just love it goes on.",5
2162,Works just like I was hoping.  Really good product.,5
2163,"Great gel liner, the color is truly a solid black and it won't budge through most of the day.",5
2164,So nice to know that is natural ingredients and not harmful to the eyes. Very Black. Goes on well.,4
2165,"That's  very good,  the good aroma , smoothie. really liked",4
2166,Love it...glides on smoothly and lasts all day.,5
2167,Stays on way better than Bobbi Brown and drugstore brands! And I love that it's not made with bad chemicals!,5
2168,This gel liner was very easy to use - very smooth and the perfect color!,5
2169,"Best natural eyeliner! Glides on perfectly, does not smudge and lasts all day.",5
2170,Very ...very mild scent.....to the point of no scent,1
2171,fantastic stuff. and it works.people tell me it smells good and I attract people to me instead of bees. Love it.,5
2172,"I like to purchase your oils,but please explain how to use the products, I like more information in using them!
Thanks !",1
2173,Smells lovely! I like to finish my makeup with this powder.,5

2181,Great quality for the price. Blends very nicely and easily!,5
2182,Great Product ... Spreads easily... Stays on long ... And doesn't look cakey!!!,5
2183,"Very dry product, ended up mixing with moisturizer so I could apply it.  You get what you pay for.",2
2184,I love it the cream base works great came in the mail faster than expected,5

2190,"Very nice to start off with, it's get the job done and doesn't take too much space",5
2191,"Great price. The high frequency works fine. The steamer is not height ajustable, that's the only problem",3
2192,so far its a great steamer! Love the HF too.,5
2193,I like it this one. The only problem i have water container is hard to twist it and if doesn't click right it is disaster.,4

2206,Item with rose never got and the three heart one fell apart,1
2207,I loved mine but it broke after like 2 weeks. Sad.,2
2208,"I love this belly ring, it doesnt break easily as long as you take care of it",5
2209,Pieces are not soldered together so it fell apart in a week.,1
2210,Got it for my girl . A couple months ago and she still has it brand new. It was worth buying,5

2226,breaks easily and too big for my neck but i love the design but it broke within first week :'(,3
2227,You guys with the 1 star reviews are dumb af... Learn how to tighten it.. You can wear it as low choker or a long necklace pretty neat,5
2228,The cord slips a little bit and the hand is bigger then I thought but its still super cute!,4
2229,Nice trendy necklace. Charm is a little bigger than I was expecting but it still looks great.,5
2230,Its adorable but the leather wire is fixed together loosely so it doesnt stay put as a choker but still cute,4

2563,This was exactly what i was looking for! it's very easy to see through even though it doesnt look that way in the picture.,5
2564,"Exactly as pictured, super adorable. The trim comes to barely just below my eye",5
2565,"Love it, it looks really pretty! Fits perfectly too - can't wait to wear it for the Halloween!",5
2566,"Can't wait to try it out on one of my models. It came a little bent up, but it was pretty easy to fix.",4
2567,"Looks cheap, feels cheap. And the headband is not comfortable. I had to go to the masquerade party with no mask :(",2
2568,"As discribed, and for the price it worked great for my costume",5
2569,So amazing!!!!! I felt sexy on Halloween in Vegas.,5
2570,These were amazing! Got them for  a Halloween costume and they fit perfect and look super sexy.,5
2571,"Looks as advertised, doesn't come completely down to eyes unless you situate it closer to your forehead but I still like it.",5
2572,I was the belle of the masquerade ball.  Fit immediately underneath my eyes and everyone loved it.  Great for the price!,5
2573,lace flares outward and does not fall against face as pictured. Had to cut the lace off to make it decent looking for my Halloween costume.,1
2574,Stitching is not even.  The face fabric was lop-sided.,2
2575,Love these they are exactly what I ordered they looked great on Halloween and held up all night. I got my friend and I matching pairs,5
2576,"Shipping was super fast! Received item waaaaay before expected arrival date. Item arrived perfect, not damage, properly fitted and just as I expected!",5
2577,"I love these! I received so many compliments on these. They arrived earlier than anticipated, they bend easily, and are comfortable to wear.",5
2578,These ears are HUGE!!! Like abnormally large.. and they quality isn't the best either.,1
2579,Cane on time and was exactly what I wanted! It was definitely the best mask at the ball. Show stopper!,5
2580,"The veil is uneven and not long enough, and the ears need to be carefully managed so the veil doesn't slip when your head moves",2
2581,My hair has never been softer!  I hope I never have to use any other shampoo.,5
2582,Definitely a good combo and an improvement over my previous brands but not as good for my real dry over processed hair.,3
2583,my hair tends to be frizzy and difficult to style. This product is the first that I have purchased that actually works.,5
2584,This is a well thought out design and the seller on top of it all sent it and it arrived better than most times from OCONUS,5
2585,"Great price, good quality.  Although I wanted black,  the dark brown will do. Plenty of space.",5
2586,"Excellent case. Nice quality for the price. It's NOT black tho. It's definitely brown. But still, a very nice case.",5
2587,Very nice!  Looks like it should cost twice the price!,5
2588,"Good enough,  but mine is not leather. Looks like it but not",3
2589,Not what I expected. I would not put my shears in here.,1
2590,Everyone at the salon love my case. It hold all my combs and shaers. Works great.,5
2591,A little hard and hasn't ever softened but does keep everything protected.,4
2592,I really like this product.  Its does not look or feel cheep for the price. Bought this for a fathers day gift.,5
2593,Over all great product! A little stiff but I'm sure I'll wear it out.,4
2594,Received the wrong item but Anself corrected the situation and I  now have my original product. Thank YOU!,5
2595,"Honestly, a great lotion. Smells so nice, not at all overpowering. Awesome value on Amazon.com. Leaves my skin soft.",5
2596,Not a strong smell..does not last long in the shower.  Not worth the money,3
2597,wish there were more for the money BUT they are amazing,5
2598,Smells amazing! I just wish it lasted longer. Ill try placing it even farther from the shower stream next time to see if that helps,4
2599,Smells great! Lasted in the shower for about 20 mind.,4
2600,Smells nice.  Varies whether it will last one shower or 2.,4
2601,"Love these to make my shower more relaxing. But since October, theyve doubled their price and no longer ship to Hawaii ",5
2602,"Smell is nice and isn't too strong. Wish they lasted longer, but then they would have to be bigger.  Overall, great product.",5
2603,Work great and produce a relaxing smell. I would buy them again.,5
2604,"The fragrance lasted for only a few moments, then it was gone. Wasn't worth it honestly.",2
2605,"These are great for aromatherapy in the shower. If you don't have time for a bath, these do the trick!",5
2606,Wonderful smell that lasts during a long shower. Also very affordable price.,5
2607,My tub-less friend loved it as a nice way to relax in the shower!,5
2608,Have not tried yet but love the other aromas so I'm sure I love this one too. Arrived on time,4
2609,So potent it makes your eyes water. Wouldn't purchase again,1
2610,As long as it is put indirect of the water it works beautifully!,5
2611,The jellyfish sting protective lotion came quickly and in new and perfect condition.  Thank you.,5
2612,Can't find this stuff any more.without buying a case. My wife has used it for decades.works well will be around many more yeare,5

2614,I'm very happy with this product and happy that you have it readily available for the consumer.,5

2617,Order fulfilled correctly and efficiently.  We are very pleased.,5
2618,"be careful not to buy the ""international"" Camay.  I does not seem to be the same.",5
2619,DON'T BUY!! DOES NOT SMELL ANYTHING LIKE CAMAY SOAP!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,1
2620,"I love using Camay soap because it smells fresh, no strong fragrant, very mild scent and gentle..",5
2621,"Only soap my husband will use, and the stores around me have stopped carrying it.",5
2622,"This product is excellent.  It doesn't let my hair frizz,  it looks shiny and with volume.",5
2623,"Leaves my hair feeling great. The smell is hit or miss, it really depends on the person. I personally don't mind it.",5
2624,only need a tiny bit but it does add shine!,5
2625,Just as great as I thought it would be !!,5
2626,I thought this was Large print.....not even close! I got to order a bible I can actually see to read.,3

2648,Are not silicone as advertised. They do not fit any eyelash curlers I have.,1
2649,It says waterproof but it's NOT .I use them for make-up instead of shampooing.,2
2650,"This looks cool when new but, the silver washes away, then it starts peeling off like sun burnt skin. Disappointed!",1
2651,Arrived fast! Very pretty and matches my salon theme.,5
2652,"Nice cape, the clasp is a bit awkward so I changed it out but the cape's sturdy",4
2653,"Foil started coming off as soon as I tried to open it, returned",2
2654,"Very cute cape, looks just like the picture...but the client is still wet after shampooing.",4

2673,"great, but where do you find replacement wheel things?",3
2674,No more replacing batteries all the time.  Holds a good charge and the power is there when needed.,5
2675,"very satisfied, is what I ordered and what I expected...",5
2676,Works very well! only issue is it's power converter only works on 110v locations. Not to be used if you need it for travel.,4
2677,"It does a great job, but you have to charge it up to 16 hours to get 1/2 hour worth of battery life.",2
2678,"Use it regularly without a glitch.  Performs well, holds its charge and comes in a great storage case.  Recommend it without hesitation.",5
2679,easy to use.  does a nice job.  seems built to last.,5
2680,A great little tool that helps enormously on feet that are very abused!,5
2681,I had my doubts but they were unfounded.  I love it and keep it charged all the time.,5

2683,Great product. Works well. As well as on my fiance's feet. We love it!,5
2684,My heels are TERRIBLE and this works so well.  So much easier than using the grater thing!,5

2699,"Nice Quality, Thick Foam, Easily trimmed to the size you need, This was exactly what I was looking for to fit a buffer tube.",5
2700,This gets 2 stars simply for difficulty of installation. What a wrestling match....,2
2701,Fit tight and secure on carbine buffer tube. Works great,5
2702,"Fits perfect on my AR pistol.  Takes some effort to install, but that's a good thing.  You don't want this thing to be loose",5
2703,"Pros- It fits very snug on the tube.
  Comfortable on the cheek.
Cons-Needs to be shortened other your charging handle will hit the first 1/2"".",3
2704,Olive oil! Use olive oil. Windex wasn't cutting it. Nice quality,5
2705,This foam cover fits like a glove ( use a little lotion to slip on),5
2706,"I had to use an air compressor to get it on, very tight fit (which I like)",4
2707,A bit too big as in my charging handle scrapes across the top as I pull it back,3
2708,"EH... HOLLOW END IS UNFORTUNATE, I WILL BE BUYING SOMETHING ELSE, PRETTY CHEAP",3
2709,Ripped apart when trying to pull it over the pistol tube.,2
2710,I like it. Not much to it but it is comfortable on my cheek.,4
2711,"Fit my 1.25"" diameter pistol buffer tube perfectly. Highly recommend.",5
2712,Used this to cover the buffer tube on an AR-15.  Did the job. Not much could go wrong with a foam cover.,5
2713,I received this product last week.  Have not had the chance to try it yet but based on all the reviews sounds like a great product.,5
2714,Only received 24 capsules in sealed bottle when it states 30 capsules. Will take what I got and see if they work,3
2715,Not sure about it.  Didn't see any difference.,3
2716,I really saw the difference in my forehead and around my eyes... I have tried other brands but didn't see anything happening. Thank you,5

2718,Have used for one month......seems to be working...yes !!,4
2719,Great product! I noticed fine lines and wrinkles deminish.,5
2720,After taking this for several months I can not tell any difference at all in my skin.,1
2721,Used for two months and it seems to be helping my years of sun damaged skin. I'll be ordering another bottle soon...,4
2722,thought it had 350mgs of phytoceramide but only had 40:(,1
2723,I really liked this. I could tell a difference in my skin shortly after starting it. It was softer and more moisturized.,5
2724,I tried vitamin C serum at the same time so I don't know what product is doing what. I like that it is gluten free.,4
2725,"the product works like it said my motherhas been taking them and her skin younger in just 30 days, she highly recommends this product",5
2726,It is easy to take only once per day. It really helps to hydrate my very dry skin. I will continue to use.,4
2727,"This primer works well, but much like many others, dries out very quickly & becomes very thick.",3
2728,looked for a non-creamy lipstick for a long time..It's great!,5
2729,Left a gooey mess in my hair. I will not be using this again :(,1
2730,I love this tape!! Not coming out without some work,5
2731,love this tape stays in my longer and does't get sticky,5
2732,"The ""free"" item wasn't a serum.  It was patchouli oil.  I found that to be weird.",3
2733,"Good vibration level, but had hoped for a bit more.",4
2734,"Love this so much, I bought one for my daughter.",5
2735,Delivered on time. Been using product for a while. I see no difference,3
2736,Pretty good product! Don't know if it's just a massage or really a therapy!,4
2737,I got this as part of a gift for the holiday's for my mother In Law . I am sure she is going to love it .,5
2738,This is a nice quality and it's small size makes it convenient & easy to use.,4
2739,"LOVE this product. It is working wonders, Bought another for my daughter. Great gifts for everyong.",5
2740,Straight out of the box it didn't work :-(,1
2741,VERY CUTE!! I LOVE BRACELETS SO THIS PERFECT IT IS LIKE SIX IN ONE BRACELETS...WILL DEFINITELY BE ORDERING MORE.,5
2742,"This apron is for a child, and I purchased 4 , totally waste my money , only putting a star because it is required !!!",1
2743,Was not happy with this I returned it. Cheap material and to short,1
2744,this apron is well made but tiny! I wear a size 10 and this looks too small on me.,3
2745,It only covers one boob and doesn't go past the tops of my thighs... wish I'd have known this was a kids apron,1
2746,"Like the look, but it seems to run small. I am a size 12/14 and it barely covers my chest.",3
2747,I liked this a lot while it lasted.  I got it in July and it's October and it has ripped already.  So 3 months.,3
2748,"Item not as described, apron could fit a small child. My shirt was longer than this",1
2749,Apron arrived quickly but was super small like it was perfect for kids and not an adult.,1
2750,The neckline is too short.  Feels uncomfortable.  Like they fit a kid.  And I'm kinda small.  5 feet 120 lbs.,1
2751,Not working ... total money wasted on Heater as well as this wax kit.,1
2752,My wife loved it!  Definitely approve.  worth every penny I spent.  easy to use and good for first timers.  good.,5
2753,"It takes too long time to heat the wax, it is writen in manual heating time 30 min, but real time is 2 hours",3
2754,Excellent product. It just made waxing experience so delightful. Loved it.,5
2755,Works fine but I think I should have invested more money and gotten the wax pot.,4
2756,"The product is perfect and it works very well, it's accordant with the description, fast delivery. I reccommend it!",5
2757,This one is the saviour :D A must have item...,5
2758,"This is absolutely useless, does not work.  I actually need to return it.",1
2759,The only bad part is that it takes about 1 hour or more to heat the wax,3
2760,"This has really made a difference in my 50-year-old skin, especially combined with collagen supplements. Highly recommended.",5
2761,These facial creams have not worked well for me.  I don't know what needs to occur for them to work but I have never gotten satisfaction.,2
2762,Too oily & not high quality...you could find better products elsewhere.,3
2763,Nice cream.  Just started using it.  Very nice smell.,5
2764,Too early to tell if it will work or not.,3
2765,"Since I travel a lot, my skin is very dry. Its help me skin to keep at best hydrate condition. I just love this cream!",5
2766,Have only been using it for a few days so no magical overnight change but I like the product and will continue using it.,4
2767,"perfume is good, but is only 10 dollars at rue21.com",5
2768,I love the coconutty smell of this perfume. It reminds me of the beach. Lasts awhile too.,5
2769,I love this stuff very hard for me to find in my small town.,5
2770,love the smell defiantly worth it if you love coconut fragrance,5
2771,It stays until you wash it off. Almost water or off.,5
2772,Don't like it. It says waterproof and Matt. It's not Matt it's shiny finish.,1
2773,Amazing card cases. I really like the matte finish! The sleeves feel really good when playing and they will last forever,5
2774,Awesome sleeves.  They have a matte finish on the back which makes it so the sleeves stick don't together.,5
2775,"Just what I need, slick, and feels good. Decent price too. Thanks guys!",5
2776,I absolutely love this product. I use it with a microdermabrasion brush. The price is right and so are the ingredients. Thank you!,5
2777,"It smells absolutely amazing, but it also leaves a very waxy coating anywhere you apply it.",2
2778,I think regular coffee grounds would be as effective and same consistency,2
2779,A week after it expanded and leaked out of the jar leaving my shelves stained..,1
2780,"Seal was apparently broken and product leaked into the plastic it was wrapped in.  What's left is dried up, stinky mess.",2
2781,what is this shock of the size please refund my money bad texture my eyes hurts when upply,1
2782,Product irritated and burned my eyes. I did although appreciate the kind follow up by the company,2
2783,"Didn't work at all, I needed it to help regrow parts of my eye brows and eyelashes but nothing happened.",1
2784,I have seen a difference in my eyelashes and had this product for 2 months...longer fuller lashes :),5
2785,"Didn't work...a waste of money....there were no instructions for this item, they were faded on the outside.",2
2786,"I've been using about 3 weeks, I have yet to see any noticeable difference",2
2787,used this 2x a day for a month & didn't see any improvement.,2
2788,"Top of the mark!  Very strong and very sharp!  If you have problem nails, this is worth the money.",5
2789,These are great for my arthritic hands.  Work like a charm.,5
2790,I picked this up at great price. Product was as it was described and the cotton wicks super good.,5
2791,Wire is perfect. Easy to work with. Great macro coils,5

2797,Exactly as advertised! Awesome deal! Will definitely buy again in the future!,5
2798,Great wires for the price! Also love the Japanese cotton bundle. Came as pictured! Happy with the product.,5
2799,Came when it said and is pretty good wire actually!,5
2800,"Best cotton I've found, wire comes completely unwound very easily though making it kind of hard to wrap coils",4
2801,Excellent quality and pricing the way business should be not 90 percent retail mark up.,5
2802,Don't see what all the fuss is about with Japanese cotton,3
2803,I tried it off and on for 6 weeks and every time it triggered a migraine for me.,1
2804,"It did not work for me or my husband.  Also, very overpriced for such a small container.",1
2805,"wheres the Sugar-Free? Stevia is gross, make a Sugar Free line.",1
2806,Love this stuff!!! Sleep like a baby!,5
2807,"This company adds stevia to all of the ""dusts"". I can't stand stevia so these are useless for me.",3
2808,This definitely helps me sleep but every time I take it I get very vivid nightmares. I'm wondering if this happens to others as well.,2
2809,"I received the good night dust as a sample. I definitely felt drowsy after drinking it, but I didn't care for the taste of it.",3
2810,"I love that this is organic but I surely did not like the taste.  Also, it didn't seem to help with me sleeping anybetter.",1
2811,I've only used it for about a week and I do feel more relaxed before going to sleep.,5
2812,I absolutely love this! Moon Juice powders are great! I have the Brain Dust as well and I must say both of these work great!,5
2813,up most of the night with this product...not a good experience,1
2814,Really puts me to sleep with no next morning hang over.  A great natural product.,5
2815,I have used this product in the evening and send it to relax me and allow me a more restful evening,4
2816,This tastes delicious! Like I've added a shot of cinnamon to my drinks. Feel more alert and appears to boost my mood as well.,5
2817,Not a good product at all. Very bad taste and does not help for nothing. Makes you irritated,1
2818,"i wasn't expecting this to do anything and it sure didn't, but sometimes it's nice to buy stupid treats for yourself.",2
2819,this is a remarkable product.  I'm sorry I didn't know about it years ago!  I highly recommend it.,5
2820,"This the best for helping your brain get motivated. Taste fantastic , have it everyday.",5
2821,I love it! I have been taking it for a few months now and I feel energized and clear thoughts,5
2822,"Flavor was fine, not sure if it really worked to help accentuate my brain power. Def didn't hurt though.",4
2823,A little sweet but put a teaspoon in a cup of tea or warm almond milk and watch those mental cobwebs melt away.,5
2824,This works well to give you a boost in mental clarity throughout the day. Haven't used it long enough though but I like it so far.,4
2825,I love this blend~ great adaptogens plus brain fueling herbs. Perfect.,5
2826,I love to use this product in my morning smoothie.  It tastes great and also gives me a good boost.,5
2827,"Maybe this stuff wakes you up, but it tastes disgusting. I just can't stomach it",1

2835,So far loving the ease of use of this product and the way I feel after use.  Will definitely be purchasing again,5
2836,Has a very neutral taste. I noticed a difference in my mood with one scoop. I would buy it again,5
2837,In love with this product! I can't wait to try all of them. You won't regret purchasing this product :),5
2838,Taste great and seems to keep me feeling alert and active,5
2839,Really natural looking color!! Doesn't rub off on clothing. Gives skin a glow without shimmer.,5
2840,"Love this thing.
The handle is amazing and its way better than crochet needles.",5
2841,Arrived in a week maybe less in perfect condition. I bought this for my boyfriend & he loves this product really helps keep his dreads tidy,5
2842,These ones work the best for. My dreads. I have like three of them now.,5
2843,"Works amazing on dreads, love the carved it finger grooves",5
2844,Watch the tip when you receive it when I got it it was bent had to bend it back in place hopefully it will not bust,5
2845,This is the best thing ever since sliced bread! I love it. It's the best tool I have found to tighten locs I absolutely love it,5
2846,"My dreads looked better for a little while, but all the hair that we wove back in using the lock sculpta came back out.",3
2847,"Being slow and gentle, it almost broke on my first REALLY loose starter lock.
If metal was stronger it'd be worth the price",2
2848,Sadly I received it today and the hook was broken  Soo i didn't get to use it.,2
2849,Second purchase and still satisfied with the quality of the tool,4
2850,Only used it three times and the tip broke. Disappointing.,1
2851,"Great idea for a tool, but it couldn't withstand the thickness of my hair. It immediately began to bend then broke soon after.",4
2852,"It broke very quickly. But was alright when it lasted. It did not gather much hair, therefore it took a little longer to dread.",1
2853,"Its useless, the tip is small like a needle point..",1
2854,This is d tool i received 1 of.... And your add shows 2...,1
2855,When I got this product it wasn't what is in the picture. I received a afro pick looking item. I am very upset.,1
2856,Repetitive and the reviewed tells prospective customers to buy more than one. Too many 5 star given next to manufactured words.. had to say something.,1
2857,Disappointed. the advertisement shows 2 of these tools but there is only one. Seems bad advertisement to me.,2
2858,Perfect! Easy to clean up my head of dreads!,5
2859,Super fine tip for lock maintenance.  Keeps you from ripping the locks apart when pulling in the stray hair.,5
2860,Gets the job done but will poke you and make you bleed so be careful! But it works excellent,5
2861,"Great useful tool. EZ to use, less bulky than counter style. Easy to clean and fill, also changing heads between users us quick.",5
2862,"Bought this for my fianc, she absolutely loves it!",5
2863,My husbands dentist recommend this for his to use on his gums.  Has made a difference!,5
2864,It was very inferior to the model I replaced.  I found the unit to be flimsy and certainly not to  the quality I expected.,1
2865,I've been using mine for several months and it is still working well.  My husband bought one and is very pleased.,5
2866,I prefer my previous  model (660) because the tank was more convenient to get to.,4
2867,It worked for a month and then stopped pumping out water,1
2868,"Pretty messy and a longer cord would be nice. Other than that, works fine",3
2869,"Surfers Salve is amazing..it is amazing on sunburns, chapped skin , bites and cutes - love it!",5
2870,"Amazingly emoliient -  use for lips, hand and feet!",5
2871,the product didn't stick very well and was see through.,2
2872,"you'll need to double up on the bandage to cover a pitch black tattoo, but they come in handy",5
2873,"If you're wearing these on your heels to protect from high heels that rub, they don't stay stuck",2
2874,"Works great, strong stick on skin and doesn't hurt when it's pulled off.",4
2875,"Not working at all... Not matching the color of the skin for me and for my friends, not covering at all...",1
2876,Always a pleasure purchasing this product. Job well done!,5
2877,"Easy to apply, easy to remove did exactly what it was supposed to do!",5
2878,Does not cover your tattoo! Expensive and you get 4 little squares!!! Crap!!!,1
2879,Says it was delivered today. But it was not in the box?!?,1
2880,No stars band-aid bandages work better no need to waste your money.,1
2881,Might as well buy a bandaid. This item fell off easily too.,1
2882,the TAPE didn't stay on for 30 minutes! better off using a band aid,1
2883,"They could stand to be a little thicker to better cover tattoos, but I would still buy them again. Probably.",3
2884,Have to use several in order to cover a light tattoo and it is pretty noticeable,1
2885,needed it for wedding day to cover underarm spots due to a problem and it looked hidious,1
2886,The material is SHEER. Does not cover a tattoo whatsoever. The edges don't stay stuck to the skin. A plain bandaid/bandage looks less ridiculous.,1
2887,If you actually need to cover a tattoo this product is not for you. Tattoo on my hand completely showed through.,1
2888,You have to use a few strips to cover a tattoo not just one.,2
2889,"Product is great, just not what I was looking for.  Thank you.",3
2890,"I liked it for its ease of use, comes off quickly and painlessly and didn't irritate my skin.",5
2891,This product didn't cover my tattoo at all. Had to use almost the whole pack for 1 application,1
2892,Very misleading but works for wounds not for covering a tattoo.,1
2893,If you like the look of pulled/bunched skin then this is for you!,2
2894,These looked worse than a bandaid! It made your skin look dry and flakey and had a weird color to it,1
2895,This is amazing! Works smoothly and although it is not waterproof it can stay all day! Loved it.,5
2896,"my go to eyeliner- very accurate brush, not the most water proof though",5
2897,"This is the best eyeliner! I always bought this in Japan whenever I go, But now I can buy this on Amazon!!! Thanks!",5
2898,"It only lasts for 1 week. However, the one I bought in Japan lasted for 3 months. I am very upset by this Amazon seller.",1
2899,I have used this to mix with other products and I always manage to get what I want. It stays on well.,5
2900,I searched for this product for months finally found it on Amazon I have use this product since I was in my teens I love it,4
2901,Just like the 70s. So glad I looked it up. A little goes a long way,5
2902,This was a staple of the 80's  and still works! Love it!,5
2903,loved it in high school 30 years ago and lovin it now!,5
2904,I absolutely love this item.... gives me a nice sun kissed look,5
2905,IT IS WAY TO DARK.  THE COTTON BALL OR  BRUSH DOES NOT DO THE TRICK.  CALIFORNIA SUN IS 100% BETTER.,1
2906,I had this product from years ago.  I was surprised to find it again. Love it.,5
2907,Indian Earth is a to die for addition for anyones beauty regime,5
2908,"Love this stuff.  Only made I need other than lip gloss, mascara, eye liner.",5
2909,"a little goes a long way , but for the price there is not too much product",3
2910,"I ordered this item,but the incorrect item of heart vitimin came. I have return that item;however where is my Indian Earth-2gram with puff?",1
2911,finally found something that evens out my skin without clogging my pores or feeling like a mask. very happy & didn't get paid.,5
2912,"OMG, I've been using this since the 60's !!!  This is all you need!  Use it as eyeshadow, blush & lipstick!",5
2913,a great product. I 've been using it for over 20 years.  thank you.,5
2914,had some of this when I was very young. It's the real deal. I love it.,5
2915,I have been using this blush for over 40 years. I love it. goes with any complexion.,5
2916,"Great product. Can be used for blush or eyeshadow. Great for tan or darker complexions and once blended in, it looks very natural.",4
2917,It was much easier to use years back.  Hard to apply evenly.,2
2918,It's too dark I thought it was more tan or bronze definitely I didn't like it ,1
2919,Still just like the 60s.....great product and so happy to find it!,5
2920,Not the original. Much smaller and container is different.,1
2921,Replaces the sun tan so your skin is not getting the sun exposure.,5
2922,Love this stuff...Been using since I was a teenager.,5
2923,amazing product - never had anything like it!!!,5
2924,I was stoked to find indian earth! Best bronzer! It's been around forever and is still the best!,5
2925,"Great make up, a tiny amount goes a long way.  I use it for fake tanning.  Love it! As described.",5
2926,The Make Up powder was a little too dark and a little too orange for me; I would have preferred a more pinkish/redish color.,3
2927,"Natural looking blush. Very nice for healthy look not artificially made up.
I seen similar item for sale on cruise ship for $50.",5
2928,I had this as a teen and love it still. Looks really natural on my skin tone.,5
2929,Love this stuff.  Been using for over 20 years. Matches any skin tone,5
2930,So delighted to have found this product again! I used it in the '70's and have been looking for it for years.,5
2931,Just like I expected - and remember . But the big jar is deceiving. Not much product in it.,3
2932,"Perhaps my.memory fails me, but this product doesn't seem to be the same.product I remember. Does anyone else have an opinion on this?",1
2933,Great product....great price! Thank you for carrying such a superb product that all stores should carry.,5
2934,This is a great bronzer.  Sponge it comes with is useless,4
2935,I did not like it ..it was too dark and it did not look natural,1
2936,Just as I remembered it from 20 years ago!! Apply it in the morning that's all you need all day!,5
2937,Couldn't believe i could still find this. This was a staple in my makeup case back in the day. Thanks,5
2938,Have been using Indian Dirt as we called it back in the day for many years.  It lasts forever. I recommend it to everyone.,5
2939,I had this a long time ago and I'm happy it's still around.,5
2940,"great bronzer I have been using it since a teenage , can also be used as a lip color .try it :)",5
2941,this powder is VERY dark!  I have olive skin and have a great tan--It is difficult to put on --,1
2942,Thank you! the product is as expected and I really like it.,4
2943,Purchased for my mother as a gift- she's been using this stuff since the 1970's!  She loved it - said it's the same.,5
2944,I love Indian Earth. When I use it as an eyeshadow even techs at the cosmetic counters ask me what I use.,5
2945,I bought this but it's just not the same or maybe I remember it differently but nostalgic. . .,3
2946,have used the product for years in the past then it disappeared from drug store shelves so happy to have again.,5
2947,It's the real deal. Color is as light or as intense as you make it.,5
2948,would give 5 stars but very very potent and very little goes a long way recommend coverig yourself up with a bib before applyng,4
2949,"I love this product, it looks so natural and it lasts all day.  It enhances face features.",5
2950,Very good all natural way to put color in yr cheeks have used this product for a number of years,5
2951,Have loved the powder for many years. So glad to still be able to get it and at a good price.,5
2952,Still using this now over a year.  Last one lasted 8 years!!!,5
2953,I've been using Indian Earth for years! It's very versatile as it can be used in many ways!,4
2954,just can't find it...lost in storage room.,5
2955,Very hard to get on evenly.  I finally just threw it away.,1
2956,Very disappointed !!! Nothing like the original Indian earth. This is absolutely ORANGE!,1
2957,"I was expecting a larger jar and quantity,  expensive for such a small amount",3
2958,The best bronzer ever...I have been using it for over 30 years and LOVE IT!,5
2959,I am so happy to receive this product! Just love the results and will reorder again when ready. Service was excellent! Thank you.,5
2960,Oh my gosh I just love this bromzer  best ever and stay on for a long time,5
2961,The powder is fine as I have used this in the 70's.  The puff is no help at all because it is like a cotton ball.,3
2962,Used this in high school.(a few years back!) Was glad to find it again.,4
2963,This one product that is so versatile.  It is very economical and can last almost forever because it requires only little amount of it for each application.,4
2964,The only makeup I will ever wear.  Been using it since I was 20 years old.  Now I am almost 70.  Still the best.,5
2965,I have been looking for this for years.  This is exactly the same as when I bought it in the 70's/80's and I love it.,5
2966,Haven't used it for 35 years. It is much darker than I remember. I will try it during the summer when I have more color.,4
2967,My wife hadn't seen this item for years and was glad to see it on Amazon. She's happy about it.,5
2968,I HAVE USED INDIAN EARTH FOR OVER 40 YEARS...I LOVE THE PRODUCT AND HAVE SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH MANY WOMEN WHO NOW USR IT...,5
2969,I find it actually was looking for. EAsy to apply if done as directed.my suggestion is to use a cosmetic brush,4
2970,They were not as all as I had pictured.  They were very tight and very short in length.  My husband could not wear them.,1
2971,These sock are not xxl.  They do not fit a man's size 13.  They will not return or refund.  Very disappointed.,1
2972,Great for hanging out at home.  I feel any size past 11 should request XXLarge..,4
2973,Adequate but not tall enough and a little short on my toes.,3
2974,Perfect.  Just like the ones they give you in the hospital.,5
2975,Another great Christmas present for the stocking plus fast shipping.,5
2976,XXLarge were too small for a man who wears 13 and 1/2 size shoes.,1
2977,Very cheaply made (ships from China). Runs VERY small.,2
2978,I'm really enjoying wearing this underneath over shirts.  It fits well & it's comfortable.,5
2979,It looks really cute in all of the photos I've seen but I never received mine in the mail so I wouldn't know.:(,5
2980,"LOVE this. Fits perfectly, I'm normally a size small. I wear it all the time & even bought on for my sister",5
2981,Have several of these. They've been useful in the summer and I expect to wear them into the winter.,5
2982,"The material isn't what the picture shows but it's definitely worth the price, I really like it",4
2983,"It's the best! Super comfy, great support. I have already ordered three of these, and this is my default bra now..",5
2984,I was not expecting the excessive padding. Quality is good though.,2
2985,"Get it here for free: http://www.points2shop.com?ref=uin1389792843
No seriously. But the product is good! A bit tight though.",5
2986,"Super cute, looks like the pictures.  Not for bigger breast women.",5
2987,Wish I went a size up but still love the look of this crop under an open back top,4
2988,"i loved it and ordered more! super comfy and great price but it doesn't come down as far as in the picture, just fyi",5
2989,"Ripping at all seems, must hand wash or it will rip",1
2990,Very cute and comfortable but not very big! If I had a chest at all this would not fit!,5
2991,"It's great, fits great. I definitely love it!",5
2992,"I'm a 32D and this bra is doing its job, very cute in the back and so comfortable.",5
2993,Great for the price ! I wear it all the time,4

3001,It's the best! For its price I defiantly recommend it!,4
3002,"It's very small, and narrow = child size.",2
3003,Fits as expected.. I really like it and it makes my boobs looks bigger !,5
3004,Tiny one size if you are bigger than a size 10 or large C or D cup don't bother.,1
3005,I love the shape! but they are a little big for me and itchy.,3
3006,Surprisingly quick shipping. Quality was good as well. I wear 32D or 32DD at Victorias Secret a day this still fits me fine.,5
3007,Very comfortable and stylish!! I've stopped wearing my underwire push up bras!,5
3008,Thank you I love them they work just right. Very happy will order again from this company.,5
3009,I love this . It left my skin soft and smells fresh not perfumy,5
3010,Gives a really clean feeling. The smell is also interesting. Lathers easily.,4
3011,Leaves my skin feeling smooth and the fragrance is mild.,5
3012,I found this fabulous brand in Oregon on a trip. I have purchased a case of their soap twice. The fragrance is clean and fresh.,5
3013,"Love this product , will  definitely buy it again!!",5
3014,I like the soap itself but the scent well its just not for me..my husband said I smelt like a grandma :(,1

3018,I really like the product and it arrived in the exprected timeframe. I will definitely reorder!,5
3019,"While I think this product is fantastic and smells wonderful, I can only give one star because it's over priced compared to other sites",1

3036,Used it for 3 weeks and didn't notice any difference,2
3037,Dies not work . Bought this product to use for my inner thighs,1
3038,This didn't work very well for my butt but is great for getting rid of freckles,5
3039,I don't like how it smells and haven't seen any result for 2 months now.,2
3040,"item came in as looked just as described in description, overall very satisfied with this purchase. would highly recommend it..",5
3041,I have been using this and am seeing some results already.,5
3042,"Doesn't live up to it's claims.  In effect, it is useless.",1
3043,"Smooth, smelled nice...no difference what so ever in hyper pigmentation left over from acne",2
3044,Does not work.  I used as instructed on the container and it made absolutely no difference,1
3045,"Save your money, don't bother with this product.  Absolutely no change after use of entire bottle.  Will not purchase again.",1
3046,"It has a bad smell and I use two bottles in one month and I didn't see any difference ...

I didn't like it at all..",1
3047,This did not work at all. Have been using for 6 months. Waste of money,1
3048,"It does fix your skin tone, but not skin shade",3
3049,Hasn't worked yet and it's been a month...,1
3050,After 2 weeks. No difference. Doesn't work for everyone.,1
3051,I have not seen any results !! It's been over 2 weeks !! Very disappointed !,1
3052,"Not really a noticeable difference, just oily, have been using it for a couple weeks-does make you nice and soft though!!",2
3053,It does not whiten. Its just lotion! what a scam!,1
3054,Used appx 15 times and do not see a significant difference :(,2
3055,"Results within 3 days. Acne scars greatly diminished. However, scars reappear once you stop using it.
And that's my personal experience!",4
3056,"Ehh...Ive been using it over a month and I didn't notice any difference. If there was a difference, it wouldve been very little.",3
3057,Doesn't work at all used for a month no results!,1
3058,Terrible product does not work I've ordered 2 for my wife and she has seen no results,1
3059,I've tried it for a month and doesn't do much,1
3060,Only had it for a week but I love that it absorbs quickly and no bad smell waiting on results,2
3061,I used it for my bikini area and nether regions but didn't see any different,2
3062,Not what I expected.  It actually dried out my hands and I have stopped using it.,1
3063,It did the opposite. Created darker pigmentation on areas after using the lotion. Very unhappy with product. Stopped using it completely.,1
3064,Over a month & still nothing. I used as directed. Will try another product,1
3065,This doesn't work. I followed the directions and waited several weeks for a hint of lightning. None whatsoever. Save your money.,1
3066,Works well but the pump on mine is broke so I have to unscrew the lid to use it,3
3067,"It seems good, but I'm still using it to see its full potential",4
3068,This product really worked on me. I would by it again and recomand it for a friend,4
3069,Bought with high hopes. It's been a month and nothing wish there were 0 stars,1
3070,"Have been using it since it arrived, and have seen no difference whatsoever, will not purchase
it again.",2
3071,I received this product a month ago. I am Hispanic and this cream doesn't work at all for my olive-white skin.,1
3072,This product really works so glad I found it and it helps fade away scars and stretch marks,5
3073,I've used this once and figured there was no need for it anymore. Not sure why i fell for this gimmick.,1
3074,"Healthy Vibes Vibrant Bright All Natural did not work for me, but thank you!",3
3075,I didn't use the product for a long time maybe 6 days but i did see my under arms change to a different/ligher shade a little bit.,3
3076,Works but takes a little while. It evens out on the skin. Works everywhere like it describes. Best skin tone whitening cream I've purchased,5
3077,Easy to use. No burning. Light and no smell. Not oily. Small bottle though. But a little goes a ways.,5
3078,"I bought it twice and I didn't see no improvement, your better off saving your money and using home remedies such as lemon and baking soda",1
3079,Haven't really seen any difference after a couple months.,3
3080,Been using this about just a few days and my bad birth mark is not as bright!!!  Hoping it gets even lighter!!,5
3081,still waiting to be lighter in nether region...:),3
3082,It does not work very fast it needs time I guess that's why I didn't like it,1
3083,"So far, so good! Not all that noticeable, but I haven't kept up with what the directions say either.",4
3084,Bottle too small no enough to tell a difference...but I enjoyed the moisturizing properties.,1
3085,"It does work, but not as dramatic of a result that I would prefer.",3
3086,Used twice a day for seven weeks. No change. No fading at all. Does not do anything.,1
3087,Lol almost paid 30 bucks for tgi and its freaking small smh i swear it better work or ima be pist off,2
3088,Didn't work and smells funny too. Would not recommend.. Don't waste your money.,1
3089,"awesome just ordered 2 more bottles , bottles should have been bigger though and same price lol.",5
3090,I've been using this twice a day everyday on my armpits and have seen no results. I am really disappointed.,1
3091,Didn't work at all. Don't waste your money.,1
3092,This really does work! It's only been a week and I can totally tell a difference.,5
3093,Used this for a scar and it didn't work. All previous reviews must have been fake,1
3094,it really works. I use it on some private areas and they are getting lighter,4
3095,So far so good. I was unsure of this product but it's slowly working. I can see certain spots lightening up :),5
3096,"I have used it for a week now and I noticed my skin looked slightly lighter. This is amazing, I also use lightening masks for more impact",5
3097,I used the lotion  for 3 weeks and no results.,3
3098,Very effective at fading dark spots and discolorations for an even skin tone. Love it!,5
3099,"Still waiting for the results, but so far so good.",5
3100,"I bought 2 bottles, I'm almost done with the first one but don't see any result yet",1
3101,Very good product.  I have only been using it for about a week now but have started to see some difference already.,5
3102,This product is amazing.  I'm ordering another bottle today.,5
3103,"it works!!!!  my spot seriously faded.  But i used 2 times a day, every day!!",5
3104,Just got it ... for a couple hour AND  I like it.,5
3105,"i am very sitisfied this item  ,  my skin is vibrant",5
3106,This is a great product. It makes me look brighter and health skin.,5
3107,This product is  amazing and works so well and fast.,5
3108,Really good quality~!. I'm really satisfied with this one!!!,5
3109,Awesome sponge.  Wish it was in handle form.  definitely will buy again.,5
3110,I like the product.  Just wish it was a little bigger.  Also wish I was able to select the colors I wanted.,4
3111,Awful. Looks like a small donut with the hole in the center. I wasted my $$ on this.,1
3112,I absolutely love these puffs. Has really helped with smoothing my skin. Best loofah I have ever used.,5
3113,It doesn't truly feel as though it's an exfoliating loofah. It feels too soft to truly be doing any sort of real cleaning.,3
3114,"Thank God!  A scrubby that doesn't fall apart with a little vigorous washing.  Tough, but not rough!",5
3115,4 months of use and it still works great. Nice medium-firm texture and easy to rinse out.,5
3116,"A little rough on the skin, more than your typical loufa.  However, design holds up much better. No unraveling!",4
3117,"Like it a lot! It doesn't lather like the other ones do, but definitely better quality",4
3118,These reviews must be fake. This loofah does not distribute soap well at all.,1
3119,Not as exfoliating as I thought it'd be. I went with ecotools exfoliating loofah from Whole Foods and it's holding up and scrubs better,2
3120,"very nice all that I expected and really good for rough skin areas, gets all ruff skin off while still gentle to the skin.",5
3121,Feels good on the skin. Holds the lather very nicely,5
3122,Disappointed! They are thin and round like a doughnut.,2
3123,Really awesome scrubby.  It holds together much better than any of the grocery store ones I have bought in the past.,5
3124,"The material is better than the typical plastic scrubbie.  Unfortunately, there are loose threads hanging from the scrubbing surface that are unattractive and annoying.",3
3125,We love it and couldn't be happier with this. If I ever need more I'll be ordering for myself and gifts.,5
3126,By far the best body scrubber in the market! Very glad I found it,5
3127,I love it. It's soft yet still exfoliates.,5
3128,They're okay. Nothing spectacular. No better than the cheap ones at Walmart. WAY overpriced.,3
3129,Perfect colors for my bath and the Bath Sponge is a wonderful exfoliator for the face.,5
3130,So far so good holds soap well not too scratchy we will see how it holds up I would recommend this product..,4
3131,Great product but the string falls off and therefore we can no longer hang them!,3
3132,Love it-great product.  Will never use a regular sponge again.,5
3133,Not a fan. Barely holds a suds and the texture just isn't as good as a standard cheap plastic loofah.,2
3134,"Nice, was a little rougher on my skin than I would have liked ,but still good.",4
3135,The loofah is amazing. It's so much better than the Dove Mencare scrubbers. You've got me sold.,5
3136,"While I can't report on long-term durability of bath sponge/scrubber, so far we are pleased with the quality - feel and functionality. Would recommend.",5
3137,"hold soap well and feels nice on the skin. i love the 2 pack, one for me and one for my wife",5
3138,It is much difficult to tell that it has dual sides as both sides seem to be the same to me.,3
3139,I love the way this loofa feels on my skin.  I work in a dusty windy environment and this makes me feel clean!!,5
3140,"a little shorter than it looks in the pic, but it is nice for the price.",4
3141,Kept sliding around and the flower on the ring fell off right away.,2
3142,BUT THE ONLY THING IS IT BREAKS ALOT XDDDD!!,5
3143,"They look really nice and fit most small wrists, but they do not stay on the arm, there is not enough connection.",3
3144,It fell apart before I could even put it on. It was super-glued very tacky. A horrible job really.,1
3145,the flower wasn't on but super glue is my best friend,4
3146,So cute but horrible quality.  It broke the first day I wore it :(,2
3147,this item was made poorly. I had to replace the chains and clasp. not to mention it did not come with the ring,1
3148,"I was expecting 2, but the price is great and I love it so I am ordering another one :)",5
3149,Love it fits great. Looks better then the picture.,5
3150,Item broke within seconds of taking it out of package.,1
3151,Broke on Tues first wearing.  Had to fix it.,2
3152,Great style size ....kind of fragile.... Had to reglue flower into ring,3
3153,It's not worth your wait or anticipation.  The ring is worthless and the length is shorter than it shows here on the arm.,1
3154,all of the fancy parts (rose on the ring and most of the bead work) fell off during transit or on the first try-on.,2
3155,Not what i thought it was. Only one piece! The ring was not glued to the rose. Very disappointed.,1
3156,Item is cheaply made and the flower was busted off of the metal when it arrived.,1
3157,It is really cool on but the ring change that connects it all fell apart. Worth the monies I paid for it!,3
3158,The price was right to go with a goth costume but they don't stay put. Was constantly fixing it on my hand all night.,3
3159,"Cheap quality, won't be able to get more then one use out of it.",2
3160,"Bad quality, the clasp is broken and there are not as many beads like in the picture. Want a refund.",1
3161,The item looked as described however it fell apart before I received it and still had hot glue on it,3
3162,Didn't realize it was only ONE wrist glove. Make sure to order TWO if you want a pair.,5
3163,piece missing or somethng doesn't attach to finger it looks cheap,1
3164,When we ladies go out on the town...we love to play dress-up...and these are stunning.,5
3165,Well made and very pretty. I'm very happy with it.,5
3166,Even though the ring part came a loose when I took it out the package is,4
3167,As soon as I opened it the ring fell off..I had to glue it back on. But its still pretty!,3
3168,"Arrived broken, ring was separated and decoration beads on top were off. Cheaply made. Never got to wear item.",1
3169,It worked very well for the problem I had with my lips,5
3170,"Didn't love this as much as the vanicream, But it worked ok on chapped cuticles.",4
3171,Recommended by my dermatologist. Best product I've used for extremely dry skin and chapped lips - and I've tried almost everything.,5
3172,Helps a lot the best lip bum I ever had.,5
3173,Worked great! Have eczema on my face and this made the itch stop and releived some dryness around my mouth along with the vanicream facial cleanser.,5
3174,My dermatologist recommend me use this for my lips absolutely love this,5
3175,Small enough to fit in my travel case.  A little goes a long way and really moisturizers without any added ingredients you don't need.,5
3176,"Great product for dry skin, it does not feel sticky, it is absorbed fully within 5 minutes and stays on even after several washes",5
3177,Great product that is hard to find in a store.  Scent free skin barrier.  Good for chapped lips.,5
3178,Good skin protectant against daily allergens and heavy activity. Has definitely prevented rashes and blisters for us.,5
3179,Better to go to gym and workout lose weight faster.,2
3180,"Love it, it actually works. I'll be ordering more.'",4
3181,Fits pretty well. My only complaint would be that the velcro sometimes doesn't hold up during the night.,4
3182,"Overall, this is a nice product.  It has a soft scent and smooth texture, perfect for making lotions to add your own scents too.",4
3183,Great set for the money. The shears are vey sharp and easy to use.,5
3184,These work really well. It's a nice little kit.,5
3185,"GR8 quality set! Easy to carry everywhere -- everything works very well, and I use it all the time!",5
3186,For the price is an excellent set.  I am not an expert but the lady that cut my hair told me is very good!!!!,5
3187,"Outstanding quality, superior delivery, and splendid packaging! Thank you A+",5
3188,My only complaint is the size of the thumb hole. Even my wife who has long slender fingers said they hurt her thumb while using them.,4
3189,Horrible. Blades don't cut worth a toot and hair just goes between the two blades instead of cutting. Not worth the annoyance or expense.,1
3190,Arrived quickly and exactly as described.... They cut great while trimming my Australian Shepherd....,5
3191,Convenient! I can finally cut my hair by myself!,5
3192,Great Quality gear! Can honestly consider them salon-grade equipment that is durable and cuts extremely well. Really impressed with the quality to price ratio!,5
3193,The razor is good but the scissors cut the hair sideways.,2
3194,I do not like them. There too big and bulky,2
3195,Very nice kit. I bought two if these. One for me and one for a Christmas present that the recipient loved.,5
3196,"The scissors are made of good material. However, the case and the comb could be made from better material.",4
3197,Fabulous kit.  I cut my own hair and my husband's hair.  These are well made.  Very pleased with product.,5
3198,"These are very sharp scissors,I used them and was very surprised. What a smooth awesome cut.will buy again!!",5
3199,"I am satisfied with this purchase. Good quality and is must have it. Will recommend it strongly. Arrived very fast, no complains at all.",4
3200,Great pair of scissors and comb.  Comfortable and work well.,5
3201,"I was really impressed with these scissors and case, especially for the price.  I would definitely recommend these.",5
3202,Not sharp. You had one job scissors. You didn't do it.,1
3203,"Thrilled with my purchase,  wish I would have done it a long time ago! !",5
3204,Trim your hair between full hair cuts.  Keeps me cleaned up and sharp between hair cuts.,5
3205,"I am happy with this product, its quality, functionality and price. Everything works good as expected.",4
3206,bought to have at home for little trims in between haircuts...great quality....,5
3207,Good! Now I get my haircut by myself every time.,5
3208,I like this couple of scissors. It's worth for the price.,5
3209,product as advertised .Scissor finger grips are for small fingers. I have small fingers no problem for me,4
3210,"Fantastic product, very high quality with a comfortable feeling when in hand. The best I have ever used in fifty years of cutting hair.",5
3211,Nice little travel kit. It has just about everything you need for a nice trim. Handy case too.,5
3212,Nice addition to my hobby...cutting hair for fun.,3
3213,"Nice haircuts, and it is so cool,too!",5
3214,Very cheap.  They broke the first time I used them and did not cut cleanly.,1
3215,"These are very nice scissors, especially for the price, and the case is great for protecting them. I highly recommend this product!",5
3216,"The little blue plastic rings fall right out of the handles. Otherwise, this product is exactly as advertised.",4
3217,not much help. laying on it hurt after a bit.,3
3218,Uncomfortable in the first night and my ear still hurt. I guess it works for some and not for others. Will try again,1
3219,Perfect for sore ears or someone who has had ear surgery.  Just the right support and seems to hold its shape.,5
3220,"Way too large in diameter, too thick and too firm,  awkward and uncomfortable.",1
3221,"I was very disappointed with this product. Not comfortable to use while sleeping. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it.",1
3222,It is too thick to sleep on.  I even cut it in half but was still uncomfortable.  I don't recommend this.,1
3223,"Should be just bit bigger more the full round of the human head. You tend to ""fall off""
 of it while sleeping",3
3224,"Too large, wish they were not so tall and half the size.  Not what I was looking for.",1
3225,"I was surprised at how big it really is, but is as described and does the job.",5
3226,Just not comfortable like my original pillow.  Its too big for this ladies head!!!,3
3227,It's great. I was skeptical but without an alternative and this works perfectly. No more painful pressure sore on my ear.,5
3228,"Uncomfortable, does,t hold shape, flattens too fast",2
3229,"I could not figure out how to use this product so, for me, it was a waste of money",1
3230,Just too thick to use under my ear.  I guess I can cut it across.  Then I'd have two!,4
3231,Product as described. Would buy from this seller again.,5
3232,"This ear pillow came without a cover, or an offer to sell one. It was too high and caused my neck to hurt.",1
3233,Its exactly what I was looking for. I just wish it came with some kind of cover.,4
3234,This device is very uncomfortable therefore I was unable to sleep!,2
3235,Didn't mean to star this useless product. It hurt my ear and is impossible to lie on. Surely there's a better solution!,1
3236,I can get a full nights sleep and not wake up without a throbbing ear. I am very pleased with this product.,5
3237,Great if you are having a problem with an ear.,5
3238,"It works. Unsurprisingly, it is not as comfortable as a pillow but wrapping with an old cut up pillow case is easy enough.",4
3239,This little pillow has eliminated all my ear pain. Forget the pillow with the hole...this works and is cheaper!,5
3240,A little to thick and large to be comfortable on a pillow.,3
3241,Very expensive mostly due to the postage and it would have been helpful for it to have a washable cover,3
3242,I can't even give this thing any stars. It came to me broken!!!!,1
3243,"I use it on my knuckles and elbows.  It really softens up dry skin, which is awesome in such a dry climate.",5
3244,Have used this product for years and was glad Amazon carries Bigelow Rose Salve.,5
3245,Smells so good and goes on smoothly. Keeps my lips moist in the cold winter weather.,5
3246,Love it! Smells sooo good and the texture feels really nice on the lips.,5
3247,I am a chopstick addict. This stuff is my far the best I have ever used. It keeps my lips moist without feeling heavy.,5
3248,Does exceptionally well what it suppose to do.. heal chapped lips... moisturize well,5
3249,This is the best stuff I've ever used on my lips.,5
3250,Only reason it didn't get 5-stars is because the container is very hard to open,4
3251,Have been using this product several years. Really like it.,5
3252,make sure you don't over saturate. its awesome without the formadehyde. stay away from formaldehyde its very dangerous.,5
3253,Cut frizz but a lack luster product.  Definitely does not straighten at all.,2
3254,I love the way it can be taken apart to store easily.  Lots of air flow to quickly dry a wig.,5
3255,Nice price for 6 stands! They work perfectly and were delivered promptly. Would totally buy again if I need more!,5
3256,"The wigs fit well on these stands. The plastic is a softer plastic than the other wig stands, which is a good thing. Great price!",5
3257,I love how organized my wigs are now. These are definitely worth it! Im definitely going to purchase these again as I order more wigs.,5
3258,Holds my wigs wonderfully. Snaps together and are strong. I highly recommend!,5
3259,"Beautiful!!!! Love this dress, just know it does not stretch....",5
3260,"They came packaged well, but one of them didn't match.",4
3261,These are sturdy and do not look creepy like Styrofoam heads. Plus the pink is super cute!,5
3262,They are fragile as far as when you remove the wig the top circle comes off but not a major factor. Great price and great functionality.,4
3263,These were easy to put together and hold my wigs perfectly,5
3264,These are AMAZING. Bringing wigs to con is such a hassle but these take up so little space and they work very well,5
3265,The attachments don't all connect well but they still hold my wigs up fine,3
3266,"Great stands...especially for wig drying!  And, you can pack them and take them with you!",5
3267,kind of hard to keep together. little pink circle falls off everytime i pick the wigs up,3
3268,They are great for hats and wigs. The top middle part that detach is a little annoying.,4
3269,I hate these things. They don't snap together and the halo part falls off each time you remove a wig from the stand. So annoying.,1
3270,"thought it would be a little more sturdy, but I love it none the less. Makes my Truck distinct now",4
3271,"just as described, looks really good on my truck, I wanted something different from the Square and Compass.",5
3272,I wanted something a Lil different ... And this is what i was looking for .... it's great made well,5
3273,This mirror is great quality; doesn't peel or bubble. It has served its purpose very well.,5
3274,"i swear by cremo products, and this mirror is no different. this mirror stays defogged for an entire shave in the shower",5
3275,Best shave mirror EVER and I've owned quite a few.,5
3276,Product had leaked inside the original packaging -defective. See image. Can't believe this was sent!!,1
3277,"Love this thing for the shower, so much so that bought another one.  Does seem easy to scratch, though.  Shaving cream smells great.",4
3278,"Works perfectly, just be sure to warm it under the shower water. The free sample is a handy size for traveling.",5
3279,Not bad. Somewhat light and hangs crooked. But quite satisfactory for the price.,4
3280,Works as advertised and the 8 oz shave cream went into my travel kit. Perfect !,5
3281,Really like that this mirror hangs on a separate hook instead of a suction cup!,5
3282,Mirror is not fog free. No better than any other shower mirror on the market.,1
3283,This things is awesome. Just follow the directions. And the cream is really really good.  to thumbs up.,5
3284,"Very nice bags for warm or cold use.  Mine have come in handy numerous times.  Thanks so much.
LH",5
3285,"Purchased several of these -for family and friends too. Perfect for home or travel, cold or hot. Vendor very reliable.",5
3286,Would like it if it did not leak like crazy.,1
3287,"Good size and works well with hot water, cold water and ice. I got the duck design that kids love!",5
3288,This is like glue on your lips. It's awful!,1
3289,Holy Crap!!!! The staying power of this  is incredible!!! Must get more colors.....Love it!,5
3290,Love this lip tint!! Stays on for hours!!!,5
3291,This stuff sucks. Drys lips and starts to cracking and flake off.,1
3292,"Such a beautiful, lemony, grassy oil. Love it.",5
3293,These are my go-to face wipes. Keep my face from feeling dry after use and are great at removing makeup.,5
3294,"I only use Ponds wipes, these were a good price",5
3295,This takes off all my makeup and is so quick and easy. One step!,5
3296,I love these! I will definitely continue to purchase.,5
3297,They are the best makeup remover towelettes out there.  I have tried them all and always come back to these!,5
3298,"Does the job, even with waterproof mascara and color-stay lip color! Never have irritation or breakouts!",5
3299,"These do a wonderful job at removing makeup. Not for removing mascara, but all shadows and face makeup come off easily.",5
3300,"Great! I have rosacea, and it did not burn my skin. Everything burns my skin. Great job Ponds.",5
3301,These work well but I find them a bit drying to the face.,3
3302,"Love these. Wipes are thick, don't smell bad, and remove all my makeup.",4
3303,Nice fragrance and does the job well . Leaves no residue when removing makeup,5
3304,The best makeup remover clothes and the best price around.,5
3305,works as good as more expensive brand. ie: kirkland,5
3306,the only face wipes i would use now.  gentle on the eye and takes off all your makeup.  LOVE IT,5
3307,my wife love it. thank you. much cheaper from amazon store. thank you,5
3308,"They are OK, prefer Oil of O'lay these have a bit too much perferm smell for me.",3
3309,Bought this for my wife and she really loved these. Good quality product for the price.,5
3310,"Cant live without these or this price.  This brand is the  not to dry and not soaking wet. Works great, perfect size.",5
3311,"Quick deliver , bargain price for mutipack

work as advertised , i have used it before. Me and my wife  like using this wet wipe",5
3312,These make my face feel so clean and they're so convenient!  Also they're not harsh on my allergies.,5
3313,The best make up remover towels. These are the only ones I can find that do not leave me all greasy afterwards.,5
3314,"Excellent to take off eye make-up, or all your face make-up.  Very gentle for eyes.",5
3315,these little cleansing cloths are great but I am not crazy about the scent.,4
3316,Been using for yrs. Use it every night to cleanse my face. of dirt and make up. Does a great job!,5
3317,I don't know how I survived before face wipes!,5
3318,I said I bought 2 of these because the price is well worth it and the product is good.,5
3319,"Buttons came off. Fits perfect on my body, but the buttons at the neck aren't reliable.",2
3320,Works so good. Skin is so smooth and almost pore free after just a weeks use. I would definitely recommend this product!,5
3321,not sure about the face slimming but for other uses its great,5
3322,It's very weird thing. I consider it a lost of my money.,3
3323,No manual came with it so I don't know how to use it.,1
3324,"Hated. Way too big, captured way too much of the skin around my mouth. Bad suction",1
3325,"I have them all; Candy Lips, Fullips, various off brands, etc. This is the best one by far, in my opinion.",5
3326,Not what I had expected.  Design could be better to make this more effective,3
3327,Great for keeping lips out of the way for teeth whitening products.,5
3328,Garbage!! And tastes like you're eating plastic when you try to use it.,1
3329,Kinda' soft silicone....not much of an exerciser.  Looks obscene too.,2
3330,Way overpriced for a product that doesn't fit in the mouth correctly.,2
3331,"Didn't get a chance to use this, my husband found it and threw it in the trash.",5
3332,To big for mouth. Doesn't fit. Waste of $7.,1
3333,It's just the worst thing I ever purchased on Amazon it doesn't fit at all very poor Construction,1
3334,"Pure junk. All vinyl,  no strength or pressure,  just makes you open your mouth wide.",1
3335,I bought it as a gag - and it scared the dog.,3
3336,Arrived quickly and looks as depicted but not sure why I ordered it.,4
3337,Couldn't figure out if I was doing it right; couldn't feel my muscles doing anything.  I have tiny lips.,3
3338,it really works. But i hurts my inside of my mouth. But i will keep using it :P,4
3339,it was too big for mouths... couldn't fit...,3
3340,Other than the rubber smell it seems like a good product.,4
3341,its a little goofy but I believe I can feel and see it working,5
3342,"When I put it on, can't close my mouth",1
3343,"This item is Sooo cool!  I can actually feel it working. I have had it a short time but so far, YaY !!!",5
3344,as a novelty item its OK. anyone serious about its use should note that all the instructions are written in Japanese.,3
3345,Love this product! All you have to do is Spray and wipe!!  Makes your shower and tub shine!,5
3346,Seems to be a good product that is keeping the shower clean without scrubbing.,4
3347,"Great product! Arrived late, which happens often with Prime lately.",5
3348,One word....PHENOMENAL!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  Spray it on and soap scum rinses right off!  No scrubbing required!,5
3349,"Works wonderfully. Use as directed, the walls shine. Spray on and walk away.",5
3350,I have a hard time cleaning my tub and this stuff makes it so much easier!,5
3351,"This stuff is the BOM. Been using it on shower since remodeling and is so easy to have a no-scrub, clean shower.",5
3352,It really works.  You just have to be patient.,5
3353,I've used this eyelash serum before and bought it again because I love it. I've used other similar products but this one tops them.,5
3354,Order this and high hopes. It's been over 3 weeks and my lashes look exactly the same.  Lesson learned,1
3355,"I don't know how it works, but it does!",5
3356,"I have had the product for five days, it is to soon to tell if it works. No reaction to the product.",2
3357,Yes it works. I use it on my eyebrows and can see growth of hair where I over plucked.,5
3358,Hardly noticed any increased length or thickness after 6 months of regular nightly use. Disappointed. Will go try Rapidlash which was what my friend originally recommended.,2
3359,I used it only on my eyebrows. It doesn't really seem to make them grow. I wouldn't purchase it again.,3
3360,I see no changes i do't know how many more i need to buy.,1
3361,It really does not work. I took before and after pictures no difference. The product is a very tiny size too! Don't waste your money,1
3362,This eyelash serum is really good. My lashes grows fast and thick. This is really effective. I love it,4
3363,"Have not noticed a difference. I've had success with RapidLash, Fanomenal and of course Latisse, but this doesn't seem to work.",2
3364,Was fine. But nothing like Careprost  (generic latisse ) only $25 from [...],1
3365,Pleased with the fact that their claims of lengthening lashes is TRUE!  Doesn't irritate my eyes like similar products that claim to do the same.,5
3366,So far seems to be working it actually is making my lashes seem fuller more to come with this review.,4
3367,Ive been using it on my eyebrows and I can see a difference in the thickness of my eyebrows.,5
3368,"like little shorter than short as closer length to natural lashes.  As for color I prefer 'brown'
do you even offer color brown?",3
3369,seems to be making a difference after 3 weeks ..try it,5
3370,This did not do anything for me. I used it twice a day for 6 weeks. Not any changes at all.,3
3371,This is a great alternative to products like Latisse! It causes no irritation and it affordable!,5
3372,"Love it, love it. Already I'm seeing a difference in my lashes. My lashes are already longer and thicker. Yippee!",5
3373,Absolutely love it! Getting older and my eyelashes were thinning...this is bringing them back! Yayyyyy!,5
3374,This works very well. Thank you so much. It arrived fast and in great condition.,5
3375,"I have such stubbly eyelashes, I can't wait to see the results.",5
3376,Haven't used it long enough to give it 5 stars. Doesn't burn or itch. Does not have a smell. Will update,4
3377,got this item about a week ago and have started seeing results I am greatly impressed by this product,5
3378,So far I am happy with this product . I have been using the serum for two weeks and can already see result.,5
3379,"I noticed a difference within a week... no eye irritation, no odd smells. Highly recommend.",5
3380,Great product. Can't wait to use it long enough to see results,5
3381,I am loving this product. Very easy to apply. Great for getting longer lashes.,5
3382,My husband has Ms and suffers from severe nausea. This gum really helps him. I have repeat order twice.,5
3383,"always works, and doesn't taste bad! Just a little spicy when you first start chewing",5
3384,this gum has saved me so many times- instant cure for nausea...oncology nurse recommended it,5
3385,"It is hard to open the cylinder, but the lens remover works great.",4
3386,Items were just as it said they would be. Very pleased! Highly recommend.,5
3387,"Did not work well.
Felt like suction cup trying to pull eye out of socket.",2
3388,great product at a good price.  This means I can carry one on vacation and leave one at home.  Will buy their product again and again,5
3389,flimsy when compared with other removers purchased in the past but it gets the job done.,3
3390,Excellent product. I would not wear my contacts regularly without these helpful items,5
3391,These do not work the same as the originals very disappointed,1
3392,"I use this to remove my rigid gas permeable contact lenses, and they do the job!",5
3393,Great little tool for removing contact len's.  Bought several for use when traveling or just about town.,4
3394,I found it difficult to use. My fingers work better.,2
3395,They are smaller than what I was looking for - so do not work that well,2
3396,This is EXACTLY what my eye doctor was selling and charging me $8.00/each.,5
3397,These are NOT worth the money. They are cheaply made and the bristles fall out easily! I went back to my regular brush.,1
3398,Not any better than something you could get at the dollar store. Made no difference in my nails.,1
3399,Love this nail polish but wish the brush was a little bit smaller.,5
3400,Haven't used it yet but I know I will love it.  It looks exactly as I wanted it to.  Thanks,5
3401,Took over a month to receive it but sharpens all my makeup pencils great!,5
3402,The cover doesn't stay on. Sharpens well though.,3
3403,Exactly what I was looking for. I love that the shavings are stored for easy disposal instead of falling everywhere as you sharpen your eye liner.,5
3404,Works well with my Eyebrow crayon as well as regular lip liners,5
3405,works on eye liner ad lip liner ... cheap price ... great little sharpener!,5
3406,Works exactly as expected. Perfect for just a basic use.,5
3407,Horrible. Breaks every pencil I put in there. Not recommended,1
3408,Just as pictured and arrived 3 weeks earlier than the estimated arrival date.,5
3409,"Love it. Very reasonably priced, easy to use, just the right size, and washes up easily.",5
3410,"I've used it, I like it? I order more of it. I'm especially happy with the 2pack and reasonable pricing. Thx. DB",5
3411,"Easy to use, stays in place and you can apply it as light or heavy as you want.",5
3412,I was really happy with the product and loved the color.,5
3413,Stupid small logo in corner makes them useless for ccg like magic or anything with text,1
3414,Jeskai never looked so good as in these Blackberry sleeves.,5
3415,If you like smooth shuffling get these sleeves. <3,5
3416,"Great color! And as always, great sleeves by Ultra Pro.",5
3417,Works well and the case protects it from getting banged up,5
3418,It's so smooth. I love it. Never buying an emery board again!,5
3419,Great quality. Nice variation in roughness for shaping and polishing.,5
3420,"Great product, does quick job of filing nails and is easy to clean.",5
3421,Smooths and files nail effortlessly. Awesome file. Less nail breakage. Came with plastic sleeve for storing.,5

3423,Just received my order this afternoon and they look  beautiful!  Thank you for the fast service and the great products,5
3424,"Sturdy, good quality, and it doesn't wear down.",5
3425,Beautiful and very easy to use.  Designed for toe nails.  Very efficient.,5
3426,"Nice pack, it has a great elastic band on it. It gets nice and cold but doesn't actually freeze. It seems durable so far.",4
3427,Fit the eyes perfectly.  Easy to microwave and stay warm for 15 minutes.  Love it.,5
3428,The reason my favorite tape in extensions are my favorite has nothing to do with the tape. Enter this tape.,5
3429,If I could I'd give it no starts. Slipped right out the same night I put it on!! Horrible waste of money.,1
3430,Used and Recommended by my hairdresser. Gives hair body; helps it stay fresh and extra day or two without shampooing.,5
3431,"I didn't like this product at all, I found it sticky and it didn't do anything helpful.",1
3432,"Great product! Adds firmness, hold & volume to maintain your hairstyle.",5
3433,A little goes a long way...especially if you have fine hair.,5
3434,these are super tiny and tried to send them back and kept getting the run around. So I have items I could not return. Would not recommend,1
3435,This mirror is great for a small bathroom. My son uses to put in his contacts,5
3436,These work great! The trick to filling these is to fill from the bottom and to not over fill.,5
3437,Nice quality bottles.  Perfect size for deoderant or heel balm.,5
3438,I ended up having to throw all of these away. As I was pouring the deodorant base it all leaked out through the bottom.,1

3440,I love them they r beautiful.  Sn match my dress perfectly.,5

3449,This necklace set really set off my wedding dress.  I loved it!!!!!!,5
3450,Very cheaply made.  Nothing like the picture but you get what you pay for.,2
3451,Ok for the price.  Not high quality.  Probably won't be able to wear it more than once or twice before it breaks.,2
3452,I LOVE it!! Stunning!! And so inexpensive!!,5
3453,It's beautiful and better than I expected it to be it deserves 10 stars for excellence,5

3467,"just beautiful. made well. nothing ""off"". I was it would get damaged in transit but packed well and arrived safe and sound.",5
3468,I love the ingredients in this deodorant. I've tried several other natural deodorants before and none of them work. This one definitely does the trick.,5
3469,I have tried at least 5 different deodrant that are all natural no aluminum etc... By far the best.... Love it so far,5
3470,This is the preferred natural deodorant for all seasons. I have tired many other products and this one beats them all.,5
3471,Better than any natural deodorant I've used. Works great and smells great!,5
3472,Purchased for the container and glad I did. Looks great and very convenient.,5
3473,"These are great and dispenser works well, unlike similar products where 2 or 3 will come out at a time instead of just one.",5
3474,"doesn't leave paper on you like cottenelle, better price too.",5
3475,This is really a great product for it being an off-brand. This is way better quality than the other name brands I have purchased.,5

4231,I like it mostly because it's a great value and it has no aluminum in it.  easy to apply with my fingertips,5
4232,Hoping to find an alternate deodorant with natural ingredients. Tried it. Didn't work. Would like to find something that does.,1
4233,"as always, LOVE primal pit paste. The product rubs in so smooth and silky! great light scent too!",5
4234,I love knowing I am not putting toxic lip balm on my lips!,5
4235,My girlfriend tried using this and she smelled like old meat.  Not sexy.,1
4236,"Reordered my second jar! Favorite and most effective deodorant I have used, and I have tried a lot!",5
4237,3 stars for the idea and the natural ingredients but it didn't work for me. Guess the search continues!,3
4238,I love this deordant. It smells good and I feel good using it.,5
4239,"Omg! Love this stuff! Natural, works, smells great. You should try it",5
4240,Super product. Has great feel & is produced with unmatched quality in mind.,4
4241,"Primal is one of my favorite chapsticks. These are great, especially if you can get them on sale!",5
4242,Love this stuff. I will be purchasing for gifts in the future. The scents are nice. Not to strong smelling,5
4243,"This one works good, usually sensitive to the natural deodorant but this one wasn't",5
4244,This product is terrible. It doesn't work at all and the seller won't offer returns or refunds. Big waste of money.,1
4245,Did not work for me.  My coconut oil mixture I make myself works much better for a fraction of the cost.,2
4246,Did not work for me. Armpits stank by mid-day.,1
4247,I was very skeptical about this product . I sweat quite a bit. I'm male  works out hard. This product has never let me down.,5
4248,"more hydrating and less irritating than other deodorants, pleasant smell that baking soda based deodorants don't normally achieve",5
4249,"Meh, didn't work for me. Oh, well.",2
4250,I'm not a very stinky woman and I have a deskjob. After a few hours it does me no good.,2
4251,It works ok on me until the end of the work day when I change and need to put on the ad deodorant.,3
4252,Does not eliminate order completely but is very good for my skin and is a great all-natural deodorant.,4
4253,Love it!  The first deodorant that works and I'm not allergic to it! I use fragrance free due to allergies and it still works perfect!,5
4254,It doesn nothing u just smell horrible. Barely one star.,1
4255,Once I tried this I have not used anything else- I like that is lasts but also washes off cleanly with no residue.,5
4256,"Works pretty well, not overwhelming, doesn't leave oily stains on my clothing.",5
4257,"gave me a rash, but several deodorants do.  I'm still searching for one that doesn't",3
4258,Unfortunate this product gave me a rash under my arms. Smells great though (lavender/vanilla).,2
4259,"works great and no irritation to skin, caused skin sensitivity when using the full strength paste, no issues with this one",5
4260,Think this made me smell more and faster than just not using any deodorant.,1
4261,"I won't use any other deodorant after finding this!  It works like a charm and love, love, love that it's all natural!",5
4262,Awesome product. I tried a lot of natural products before I found one that works. This is the best.,5
4263,Tried this product multiple times and types and always end up with burns under my arms. Give up.,1
4264,So far its the best deodorant for me on the market. I am on my 3rd bottle.,5
4265,I have tried many different kinds of natural deodorant....this one works!!!!,5
4266,I would get the regular strength next time but preferred this container to the stick. Great product,5
4267,Love this company and love their products!  Keeps me dry and smelling fresh without any irritation!,5
4268,This is the ONLY deodorant without chemicals that can keep me from stinking.  Hallelujah!,5
4269,"No irritation, no smell- which is a good thing, since that is what I ordered- and it feels AMAZING.",5
4270,"quick ship, perfect for starting the chemical free life!",5
4271,It made me break out in a rash. It does have a warning on it that says may irritate some people's skin.,2
4272,"If you are looking for a natural deodorant that works, your search is over.  This stuff is amazing.",5
4273,"Only worked for me about half the day, disappointed bc it was expensive. It does have a nice texture.",2
4274,I guess it's not for me. It made my armpits have a dark cast and itchy,1
4275,Rediculously small amount of product for the price. Wont buy this again.,1
4276,Bought this for my wife. She try to for a few days. And it still made her itch.,2
4277,I was worried a natural deodorant wouldn't really suffice. This product is the real deal. I'm really happy I made the switch,5
4278,Works as well as any natural deodorant I've tried.  Scent is pleasant but not overpowering and the consistency makes it very easy to apply.,5
4279,Got this recently as I was looking for a nontoxic deodorant. This is EWG recommended and I can thankfully say it works great and smells great.,4
4280,"HAve been using this for over 1 year, love it and love that it's aluminum free!",5
4281,"I like the idea of this, but trying to switch over from mainstream brands of deodorant was too hard.  It just felt so sticky.",3
4282,"Love it! I added a few drops of lavender essential oil to it, as I do with my unscented shower gel and body lotion!",5
4283,I'm shocked.  I finally found a natural deodorant that actually works.,5
4284,"This is the only deodorant I have ever used that actually works, this stuff is awesome and I will continue using it! Lemonade is my favorite!",5
4285,Was looking for something without all the chemicals for my tween daughter - this is perfect.  No rashes or issues definitely recommended for people with sensitive skin.,5
4286,I am very happy with the Primal Pit Paste! My husband and I have been using it for 3 weeks and have not been disappointed!,5
4287,I highly recommend you guys these lip cream are the best I think better than Anastacia amazing try them,5
4288,"Nice, vibrant colors, but they don't last long.",4
4289,"Quality!, better than ""high end"" NOT DRYING!, very pigmented &:comfortable to wear, I will buy AGAIN......",5
4290,Gift to my grandkid! She loves it and stays on long ,5
4291,"I really love this product, the colors are beautiful and lasts forever. It goes on wet like a gloss and eventually dries to a matte.",5
4292,The colors are a bit flat.  I didn't like them,2
4293,I love these.  I'm very happy that you get six in the package so you can choose different colors different days.,4
4294,I love the variety of color and how it stains my lips so even after the first coat wipes off it still has color.,5
4295,Love these! They apply on smoothly and aren't drying unlike my other matte lip creams.,5
4296,I love these lip creams! They are cheap but really great! Love all the colors!,5
4297,I'm definitely buying more of these metallic tattoos to rock over the summer!,5
4298,"I honestly love this collection. Bracelats, necklaces and all! I always get compliments on them. Highly recommended.",5
4299,They are very durable and the pack comes with a variety of tattoos. Very easy to put on! Very fashionable love them!,5
4300,"The tattoos are all very beautiful and versatile. My one issue is that, at least on me, they wore off in only three days.",4
4301,These are the best. So easy to tear apart and put on in seconds. Love them!!!!,5
4302,Great metallic temporary tattoos! Perfect for casual night out and easy to remove. Lots of options as well!,5
4303,Absolutely gorgeous! Love how beautiful they look. Very happy!,5
4304,Great love it and I have only been using it for 5weeks now and my stuff is 50% better,5
4305,Absolutely love this product! Made my skin smooth!! I definitely recommend it!,5
4306,"I loved it, but had a nutty odor, not what I expected.",3
4307,"It has a smell to it, also its kinda greasy feeling and leaves my face feeling sticky. Probably will not buy again.",3
4308,"Using product, no sure if there are any benefits, because I use with several other products.",5
4309,Didn't do anything for my face but started using it on my sun spots on my arms and it has helped them!,3
4310,I really like this product! I am on my second bottle..,5
4311,Very easy to apply and very good for my skin.,5
4312,It did not do any harm to my skin but I bought it to clear up some scars which did not go either.,3
4313,"Love it, get it! Easy to apply, helps with acne, brightens skin.",5
4314,this opulent did not work for me. It made my under eye darker.,1
4315,I use several products and look younger than I through.,5
4316,This does everything it saids.  I am an older person and definitely will order again.,4
4317,"Both of my girls LOVE these ponytail holders. They are a variety of colors, so they will go with anything!",5
4318,My daughter absolutely loves these pony tail holders!!!!. Great service with a fast response. Great items for gift giving!,5
4319,"little bit redder/dark..i love the color (i shy away from reds, because i'm thinking i look like a harlot...lol..",5
4320,Love these however they're 14 bucks on the actual la splash website and right now there's a Black Friday special till Monday for 10 dollars.,5
4321,It's an excellent product but it's nothing like permanent. It fades out when you eat oily food.,4
4322,Wear great for up to 4 hours then starts to breakdown and get crumbly as it wears off. BEAUTIFUL COLOR OPTIONS THO!,4
4323,This product is HORRIBLE...absolutely unwearable. It's down right disgusting! I have never used a lip product that cakes on lips like this.,1
4324,I loved it.. It did not dry out my lips.. The color was vibrant and beautiful.. I was pleased and I would recommend it to a friend,5
4325,"I Like it!  Will be a better shade worn over a darker lip pencil, was lighter than I thought it would be.",4
4326,The colour is beautiful but very matte.  It is very drying. You will need to moisturize your lips beforehand and while wearing it.,4
4327,it doesn't look the same color of the picture.,1
4328,The product is very flaky compared to other liquid lipsticks. I am not a fan.,1
4329,"Great lipstick!  Color is great, stays on even after a meal.  Highly recommend",5
4330,It felt like I had smeared clay all over my lips. Never buying this product again!,1
4331,"Beautiful color ~ truly a stain. Careful when removing, not to take off first layer of skin.",5
4332,The color is beautiful. The only problem I have is that the product spills out of the tube when I close it.,4
4333,They weren't kidding these are very very tough to remove. I love them going to buy more,5
4334,Beautiful color and the brand lives upto its name and hype,5
4335,"Works great, but does pill and feather when eating.

I don't care for the overly matte finish. It makes lips appear flaky",4
4336,"Beautiful color, stays on for a long time, doesn't smear, kissable! Amazing color, amazing lipstick!",5
4337,Be warned this is very matte. I would suggest prepping and moisturising lips before application. Dries down to a great natural looking colour.,4
4338,"This lip color has a veryyy long wear! Although the color itself doesn't look good on me, it doesnt budge!",5
4339,Yes it does stay on but it cracks and it becomes clumpy once you eat or drink something,1
4340,"Love this color, although it certainly appears as more of a bright fuschia/hot pink color on my skin tone.  I will definitely purchase again!",5
4341,Just what I was looking for! & not bad for the price!,5
4342,Thought these were self moisturized. Too hard to walk in the socks when you have cream on your feet.,3
4343,Nice set for price.  brushes are a bit on the thin side.,3
4344,"some brushes had a lot of bristles come lose, it was annoying",3
4345,I bought this item for a gift.  I am very pleased with the quality of the brushes and the case.,5
4346,Wish the brushes were labeled to help someone who doesnt know what the brushes are for  otherwise its a quality product nice and soft brushes,4
4347,It's a wonderful product! High quality and very soft brushes! I recommend this and would love another pair!,5
4348,Shipped quickly and nothing was broken or lost. In love with them!,5
4349,The experience was amazing because the product is better than I expected...,5
4350,"I love all the brushes, except the cover of the brushes that didn't look fancy, everything else was great!",5
4351,They are true to the picture only thing I did not like was the sponge it was cheap quality but everything else was good :),4
4352,My lady brought this for me to carry my clippers in with style..she the best..,4
4353,It's just not enough it's nice and beautiful but not practical the handle it's not working it drives me crazy :(,2
4354,This is the perfect case for going on location to do bridal hair & makeup.,5
4355,Best face cream on the market - hands down. Their products are awesome and my skin has never been happier or looked healthier.,5
4356,The Myrrhaculous cream is amazing! They really mean it when they say a little goes a long way! My skin looks so vibrant it's awesome!,5
4357,"Best out there, comes quick my cousin and I use it all the time and mine even lasts a week with one coat.",4
4358,Love this!  Love that it comes with everything you need to apply.  Looks very natural and doesn't have the awful sunless tanner smell.,5
4359,This was my first self tanner and I really enjoyed it. Big bottle and should last a good while.,5
4360,Ive tried several different self tanners and this is the best! Immediate results that last and no funky self tan smell most leave behind until you shower.,5
4361,DID NOT WORK ON MY WIFE. WASNT DARK AND CAME AS SOON AS WENT IN OCEAN. FEEL SAD FOR HER,2
4362,Very happy with the purchase for this price. I am sure there are much more high quality brushes out there but on a budget this works.,4
4363,I was ordering an ECO brush. When it was delivered I was surprised to see a different brand the bristles were too soft,1
4364,Couldn't get past the smell. I gave it away.,2
4365,Just one comment...I don't hide my hands anymore. Something that works...finally!,5
4366,Nothing special about it. I wouldn't buy it again.,2
4367,"First time using this hand lotion, so far so good!",5
4368,Hand cream was nice but it had way too much fragrance for me. Gave it to a friend who loves it.,1
4369,The lotion works great on very dry cracked hands.  There is a huge difference only a week after using it.,5
4370,"Very light, but seems to work well. Not greasy.",5
4371,This left my hands so soft and moisturized.  I love it!,5
4372,"Best hand cream ever!!! Smells wonderful, I get so many compliments
When I wear it!!!",5
4373,Really nice fragrance and not greasy. Perfect fit for my purse. I would order again.,5
4374,Great product at a great value.  Really makes your skin soft!,5
4375,This product is awesome!  Heals the dryest of hands.,5
4376,Love this hand cream!  Feels wonderful and is not greasy at all!  Will definitely reorder.,5
4377,This is a great cream.  It doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy.  It's a great moisturizer.  Only drawback is it's price.,5
4378,Seems to work immediately and has a pleasant scent. I will definitely purchase this product again!,5
4379,Love it.. It is amazing and i will definitely order it again,5
4380,Really great natural hand moisturizer! It seems to go above and beyond - I can feel the difference!,5
4381,The bird feeder provides an opportunity observe the birds up close all year long.  Fantastic!,5
4382,I really like this product.  Feels very nice.  Not sticky at all.  Is there another scent?  Does anyone know?,4
4383,This was a gift for my mother. She says she 'loves it'!,4
4384,Love it!!! It doesnt feel like you have anything on its so nice and smells great I definitely recommend to everyone!,5
4385,Thank you for this hand cream. I am realy appriciate Amazon)) thanks again,5
4386,my hands showed a difference after just two uses.  It leaves you feeling silky without feeling sticky.,5
4387,"The scent of this hand lotion is absolutely divine, and it fits perfectly in my purse for on the go!",5
4388,Light perfume smell but I actually really love the clean scent. I use it at work everyday!,5
4389,I really liked the hand lotion. I would recommend it to anyone that wants a non greasy cream for hands and elbows.,5
4390,"Short result once i wash may hand, all the softness goes away",2
4391,"This hand cream is lovely so far. It's non-greasy, lightly fragranced, & moisturizing!",5
4392,"This is great hand cream,will be buying it again,thank you",5
4393,The smell is quite good and my mom just loves the hand cream a lot! Great product ~,5
4394,Horrible!!!!!! Don't buy!!!! Doesn't seem organic!!!! strong perfume smell!!!!,1
4395,I really like this hand cream and will be purchasing more of Leilasalts products!,5
4396,"This lotion properly hydrates my skin, and it even smells good!",5
4397,"I love that this is all natural.  It does tend to flake off during the day though, so you may just want to have it handy.",3
4398,This is a great product and I will order again!,5
4399,Love this eyeliner! Will buy again! Stays on and is easy to apply.,5
4400,I have very sensitive eyes.  This product did make me itch a little but much less than other products.,4
4401,I am sorry I don't like the product because it doesn't longer eye lid . I don't believe is waterproof.,1
4402,This is the absolute best eyeliner I have ever bought!  It stays on for the entire day & no smudging or raccoon eyes!  LOVE IT!,5
4403,My wife likes it and it just takes a few tries to apply easy and we recommend it to everyone.,5
4404,This product says not tested on animals. They may plan on selling to China.  Deal breaker for me.,1
4405,I wish this product worked for me but it did not.  It was irritating to my eyes and made them burn.,2
4406,"I love this eyeliner! But,, a overpriced for such a little tube.",4
4407,WAY better than any other name brand product with toxic chemicals!  I love it!,5
4408,Gluten free and glides on like a charm. 4 stars simply because of the amount for 20$ and the applicator could be less sponge.,4
4409,"It flakes off sometimes and lands on my eyelashes, and is pretty difficult to put on straight.",3
4410,"Like it. Only used twice now, Easy to use. thank you",5
4411,Just the fact that is made out of Natural ingredients makes me like it.  It's a good product. Works out great for me.,5
4412,"Great liquid eyeliner; doesn't run, though it does dry quickly during application.",5
4413,"It's great and it doesn't burn if it goes into your eyes, easy clean",5
4414,This is the brand that works.  It doesn't leave a sticky dark residue on skin.,5
4415,"I use it to keep the ""girls"" in place in a low-cut bra for special occasions.  Works like a DREAM.",5
4416,Not good for silicone breast forms. Product does not set so forms are slipper or can come off,1
4417,My garments stay put from 6am to 9pm!  I have very sensitive skin and have not irritation from this product.,5
4418,Works well for keeping clothing in place without the use of mechanical means.,5
4419,"Love the product.  Hate the bottle.  Once open, this bottle will leak if laid on its side no matter how tightly closed",1
4420,Works great seems to stay sticky longer than other brands unless your really sweating it holds stocking all day long,5
4421,"""It Stays"" does keep my stockings in place. What more can I ask for?",5
4422,This far from medical quality. The least bit of  sweat and it doesn't work,1
4423,It does a Great job keeping my compression stockings in place.,5
4424,I use this every day to keep bra straps in place.  Lasts all day and easily washes off skin and fabric.,5
4425,This did not work on by wedding dress which had a cotton backing. I couldn't get the fabric to stick to my chest with this glue.,1
4426,This really works well in holding up compression stockings.  It should work equally well in other uses preventing those unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions.,5
4427,This is the brand we use and recommend with a thigh to toe compression stocking.,5
4428,"The roller ball was hard to get started but once it got started, it works great.",4
4429,worked perfectly for my daughter's dance competition and recital.  It kept her costume perfectly in place.,5
4430,Really like this product. I use it to keep my arm compression sleeves up and in place.,5
4431,I have been using this for 6 years now and I'd be lost without it.,5
4432,Worked fantastic! I did have to re-apply after a few hours though.,5
4433,This body adhesive works very well. I use it to keep my compression hose where they belong.,5
4434,I love this product! I use it for compression stockings and bra straps.  They stay up!!,5
4435,"Product is good, just think that for price it should come in 4 pack...",3
4436,"As far as body adhesives go, it does the job. Keeps my compression stockings up all day long and cleans up with a wet towel.",5
4437,The best of any pine nuts out on the market!  I have read all of the Ringing Cedar books so I knew to order these,5
4438,"These are the best I've found to date. A bit pricey, but very good.",5
4439,These are some very good pine nuts. Wonderful creamy taste. I would highly recommend them.,5
4440,These nuts taste very good. I think we eat the whole bag in one day :),5
4441,Stencils are way too big for a normal face. But the compact is awesome!!,3
4442,"You get a lot for the price,very happy.",5
4443,"Great, but wished the stencils were plastic instead of wax paper so they could stay in place easier",3
4444,"its cream base. Its not working well for me, I have to go back and use my other power type eyebrow makeup.",3
4445,This makeup product may not be working at all on my eyebrows :(,1
4446,"It's okay, looks somewhat patchy. Wouldn't purchase again",3
4447,purchased to have a template to wax my eyebrows.  love the product. wish instructions came to explain how to apply.,5
4448,It does the trick. Not quite what I expected but it works.,3
4449,Great price. Like the shapes. Will last a long time. A little goes a long way,4
4450,the stencils are not easy to use. shape is off.,3
4451,"needs to be reapplied often, especially in the warm humid days",2
4452,Nice product.  Give it a try.  I mixed the light and dark together to get the shade I needed.,4
4453,"I was very excited about the bug fan brush but  it actually didn't come with it

If i could i would give you zero stars",1
4454,Not my favorite - still searching for a brow product to love.,3
4455,Love it love it it is just  as described  it works well  goes on easily and stays on all day without any applying great product for the price,5
4456,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  Looks natural and stays all day.,5
4457,It came on time and is exactly what is pictured here! So much better and easier to do my eyebrows now that I have them! :),5
4458,Didn't realize the color would be so dark. Otherwise I am very happy,4
4459,THIS IS A TERRIBLE BUY. The stencils are so hard to work with. And plusssss the shapes of the stencils are so ugly!,1
4460,No idea how to use the archers but the brow kit was great i use it daily almost time to reorder!,5
4461,have used this product for years. nothing else for me,5
4462,"This foundation feels soooo light weight! It is not cakey in any way! It also blends so well! Amazing, I love it",5
4463,"Great coverage, but too drying and highlighted lines and wrinkles.",2
4464,Took almost a month to get this. Not worth it.,2
4465,One of my wife's necessities at a competitive price and delivered to our door without the usual hassle of shopping around by car and foot!,5
4466,The only brand I use.  Perfect match and doesnt itch.,5
4467,Excellent but I purchased a shade that is too light but it has a great formula.,5
4468,Used CoverGirl for years and gave this a try. Love the coverage and the color is perfect.,5
4469,"Love this revlon product,once you find your true color you wouldn't be disappointed.",5
4470,WRONG Shade!! Checked out with 150 instead I received 180 and the tag on it still says 150.,1
4471,I use to use high end foundations exclusively until I saw a blog comparing foundations one day. Now I only wear this foundation and love it!,5
4472,Does not match my skin tone. Used it once and got rid of it.,3
4473,This is a reorder for me. I have sensitive skin and this product works great for me.,5
4474,As usual this make-up is tried and true everyday foundation. There are so many colors for you to choose from. The pump dispenser is the BEST.,5
4475,"Thin, didn't cover, even look like I was wearing makeup. I have very fair skin and it was too fair for me.",1
4476,"This is my favorite makeup.  And now that it comes in a pump, it's perfect!",5
4477,This is a great foundation and looks fresh all day.  No problems at all and I will continue to buy it!,5
4478,I need foundation that covers my rosacea without looking too heavy. This works very well for that purpose.,5
4479,It's a good product but for me I think I need something a  little  lighter not colour but texture it looks to heavy on me not natural,4
4480,Great coverage. I use this everyday. Non-oily and easy to blend,5
4481,This is my favorite foundation. Lasts a pretty long time. I've been using it for over a year.,5
4482,No matter how much I moisturize this makes my skin look dry. I had high hopes for this product but it won't work for me.,1
4483,Great coverage. I would say 1 coat is medium coverage but is definitely buildable to full coverage. Does not oxidize. Definitely repurchasing.,5
4484,Love Revlon products! Been using them for years. Best drugstore makeup brand for me!,4
4485,"only foundation i use. it is waterproof. i am in the ""hot flash"" time of my life and would never be without this makeup.",5
4486,"This is the best foundation ever, and now that it comes in a pump so much easier to use",5
4487,I have been using it and I am very happy with it,5
4488,My favorite foundation. Great coverage and not too heavy!,5
4489,My expectations were meet because it was as was started and the brand I always use.,5
4490,I love this stuff. Great coverage and I'm so happy Revlon is again selling this in the pump bottle. One pump dispenses the perfect amount.,5
4491,Initially it was extremely runny. After shaking it up a few times it came out much better. Nice color and coverage.,4
4492,"I love the product -- less expensive than in the store, but worth the price.  Great quality -- recommend!",5
4493,Great product with really full coverage. I love it. Will buy again,5
4494,Does exfoliate well.  A little small on the size.,5
4495,Really feels good! Just the right amount of scrub and silky too.,5
4496,Excellent for exfoliating the skin. I've ben using ayate for years. This is the best price I've found online.,5
4497,A little coarse and a little too small. But useful for the feet.,3
4498,I loved the texture but the towel was WAY TOO SMALL!!  Was impossible to use to wash my back. Works well as a facial towel.,3
4499,Got this several times. Every shipment items received are getting thinner and smaller.,1
4500,Absolutely fabulous! It cleans deep down with out feeling scratchy or abrasive! ,5
4501,"Great exfoliating cloth. When wet down the first time it shrunk down to a nice handful size, just right. The fibers are just right too.",5
4502,"Great product. After using for the first time, the item shrunk too much. Sometimes not easy to handle but the quality is just great.",5
4503,"Feels great to exfoliate with this cloth, natural and gentle. My skin felt slightly tingly and was somewhat rosy colored after my shower.",5
4504,"Big disappointment. too stiff and hard even when soaked as instructed. My skin thin and fragile, can't use",1
4505,Silky smooth skin after the first use. Even noticed less cellulite after a few more uses. I love it. Will be purchasing more.,5
4506,I have always used Exfoliating Scrubbers and this one is excellent.,5
4507,"Excellent quality material! don't know what else to say, just a great product.",5
4508,The material is too hard for me! it is too strong for my body Exfoliating. but i use it for feet once a week.,3
4509,Broke while putting it on! Complete waste of money! Definitely do not recommend! Would like a refund if possible! Please and thank you!,1
4510,Cute little ring. Doesn't stay shiny very long but didn't cost much,2
4511,It broke as soon as I tried to adjust it to fit,1
4512,gave this to my sister just was my style just didn't look right,3
4513,So cheaply made. Broke before I even got to put it on! Don't buy.,1
4514,Looked great. Strong metal but turned black and stained my toe in about 2 hrs. Did not wet it. Disappointed.,1
4515,It was good for a while but shortly after I wore it for about a week or two and it broke in half. :(,3
4516,Color of ring started turning black after one day of wearing. CHEAPLY MADE...not worth one cent!!,1
4517,Came bent up and loose when repairing. For the pennies I am bot angry.,1
4518,Very cheaply made one day turned toe green Not happy with product I would not tell anyone to buy this,1

4522,i got one of there for my mom and it turn brown,1
4523,"Never got to wear it, very cheap broke in half when I tried to put it on.",1
4524,Doesn't even deserve a star. Rusted the first day i had it,1
4525,It's tiny and Cheap but it gets the job done and it's adorable,3
4526,Turned green and wasn't like the picture at all!,1
4527,No matter how small I make it it still shifts way to much and I cannot pinch it together to fit,3
4528,"I like it, but definitely after hitting water, it got rusty fast and made a greenish bluish tint on my toe",3
4529,The toe ring from lookatool company is the best the perfect size and fit would recommend to my family and friends,5
4530,They sent me a replacement since than no problems. I like it.,4
4531,Immeadiately broke while trying to adjust the size. Didnt even get to wear it at all. Also the design looked more clunky than in the picture.,1

4533,These are a great deal. They are so soft with hardly any fall out and they're so pretty. I would definitely purchase again.,5
4534,"These brushes are beautiful, the picture doesn't do them any justice. So far I haven't had any issues with them.",5
4535,I have cleaned these brushes 5 times and they still smell like a factory. The brushes themselves work fine if you can get past the smell.,2
4536,beautiful stylish color soft great quality great price I'm tempted to buy another set (*^_^*),5

4543,just what I was looking for a good deal for the price,5
4544,These are not flushable but that's my fault for not checking before ordering,4
4545,Have used this for several years and is very gentle to sensitive skin.,5
4546,"Excellent, hypoallergenic, soft cloths for fast easy clean ups. I use them especially at the office.",5
4547,The chain was a little flimsy but was beautiful overall. The exact look I wanted.,4
4548,"This piece is so beautiful, and I love how it clips easily to your hair. I can't wait to wear it at my wedding!",5
4549,it works! Just lift and put it on you're lips and sleep on it. It dries like a tape when it's done.,5
4550,I gave 2 stars for the fun aspect of it but otherwise it doesn't actually do anything for your lips.,2
4551,They were falling apart when I opened them. Tear easily! They do feel nice and relaxing but not sure if they do anything.,3
4552,"I love these, they will not give you huge lips, but they hydrate your lips so well.",5
4553,This is so much fun to wear and my lips feel refreshed and happy.,4
4554,"What did I just buy?  This was a nice little gimmicky purchase, but I saw no difference in my lips after 4 consecutive nights using it.",2
4555,"It is not comfortable to use, but it does moisturize well",3
4556,Pretty Slimy but I think it may help plump...a very little though,2

4560,Not that great. I itch a lot after using it.,2
4561,Eh.....nice rich lather but not in any way a sandalwood scent.,3

5577,Do not purchase .. These are a knock off of the struts .. Very poorly made with substandard materials !,1
5578,working well does a great job at making feet feel better,5
5579,poor quality...the elastic is not very stretchable... very thin poor construction...a bad copy of the good cushioned pads!,1
5580,"Inexpensive, but does not have as much cushion as in the picture.  Stitching quality is poor to fair.  Will work for occasional use.",3
5581,Didn't work at all. No cushion. Glad I didn't pay much.,1
5582,"Waste of money. Poorly made, didn't last 2 weeks.",1
5583,"I was limping badly before wearing this, and while it has not yet cured the problem I'm walking without noticeable problems.",4
5584,This item is great if you have arch problems. I really like them.,5
5585,Not what I was expecting the band is a little snug and don't think it will help with my poor circulation...,3
5586,"No eben available to use it, is like a piece of paper DON'T buy it you will waste your money.",1
5587,These takes the pressure off of my hills. They are washable and look attractive. Very reasonably priced.,5
5588,They did not have much cushion on the bottom.  I have ordered these before and they were much thicker on the arch of my foot.  Disappointed.,1
5589,"Great and comfortable to use barefoot, as weel as in shoes or sandals!",5
5590,Great feel great on likes the way my feet feel after a day of wearing them.,5
5591,A little cheesier version of the Strutz brand of (fabulous!) arch supports,3
5592,Really helped take the pain from my plantar fasciitis.  Only problem I have with it is that the elastic causes my feet to sweat  and irritated.,4
5593,"Cut very poorly and half sewn. These are not worth the cheap price, Spend a little more for the real thing. Horrible!",1
5594,Good product. They give me just the right gentle support.,5
5595,price is good. construction is not perfect but it is holding together and comfortable to wear.,4
5596,"Light, easily fit in shoes and gave nice support.",5
5597,"Cheap, I got my money's worth on these. i will order the real ones from Strutz next time.",1
5598,"These look much like other more expensive arch supports, but the pads go flat rather quickly.",3
5599,"These are completely flat and offer almost no arch support, which is the whole purpose of the product.",2
5600,"Helps a bit. Worth a try. This is my 2nd purchase. Easy to wear with shoes, sandals and flip-flops. Also barefoot.",5
5601,"Works well for my High arch.  Gives support, where needed",5
5602,"They're a little snug, but I'm sure they will stretch and be okay.  Thanks.",3
5603,Those worked great.  It did burn my eyes if I got to close. BUT I saw growth!,4
5604,"This product worked somewhat alright on my eyelashes, but did nothing at all for my eyebrows.",3
5605,"Burns my eyes. I have used other products, so my eyelashes were long.  Quit this before I could know whether it works.",2
5606,Great bag with lots of room. As advertised. Great for travelling.,5
5607,This brush is very thin. It's much lower quality than other brushes I've purchased for the same price. I'll be throwing it out.,2
5608,great brush used it to even out my make up and it was great and I got to try it for a low price for a review,4
5609,Daughter is very happy with these.  Very easy to apply,5
5610,"Somewhat difficult application but with a couple of failed attempts due to very thin and delicate film, I was able to master it with forceps.",4
5611,These stickers are too big for child's nails. They really can only fit on an adult nail if you have long nails or acrylic.,1
5612,"Really like it, firs well, heavy and good quality",5
5613,"My wife got married wearing this, and she loves it. But one side broke on it (still stayed on).",4
5614,wife said somewhat small in the breath but she loves it,5
5615,"Beautiful product. Perfect fit, high quality, and an affordable price. I would highly recommend this top.",5
5616,"I LIKE IT BUT IT IS SOMEWHAT SMALL AND ITS A X-LG WHICH I WEAR.
BUT LIKE I SAID ITS SNUG FIT.",3
5617,Broke the day I got it cheeply made very disappointed.,1
5618,Love it thank you !!!!!! Beautiful,5
5619,Really big and clunky. Falls off and is hard to manage. It is pretty but not for long wear (aka wedding).,3
5620,"It is very pretty, but arrived with a crystal missing and it was stretched out.",2
5621,My daughter wore this as a mini bride in a wedding this past weekend!  It was absolutely stunning!!,5
5622,These are very cute. The product inside is very very lightweight. So mostly it's for fun. Not Chapstick.,3
5623,"Uhm, the lip balms are tiny!!! But they are so cute. They have a sweet smell and are far from waxy.",4
5624,"Helped make my skin at least a little nicer, although my acne isn't away 100% yet, but it seems to be getting better",5
5625,I'm never going to quit you &Eacute;tude House Wonder Pore.,5
5626,I have sensitive skin and this gave me a full on rash for several days after use. not for dry skin.,1
5627,This was a good face wash. I would recommend it,5
5628,"It's alright, not too harsh. Probably won't buy again.",3
5629,I use about a pea size to wash my entire face and neck. Amazing clean and fresh feeling afterwards.,5
5630,AMAZING cleanser! My daughter has dealt with acne for years and THIS is clearing it up! Amani got! Will be buying more!,5
5631,"I use this everyday, I love it so much!! This entire wonder pore line is great honestly.",5

5633,My daughter loves this line of cosmetics.  I guess it's working.,5
5634,"This stuff feels so good on my face and has completely transformed my skin care routine. Thank you, Etude House and Korean Skincare.",5
5635,To be honest this didn't meet my expectations since I love the toner but this cleansing foam I feel like it didn't do anything.,3
5636,This deep foaming cleanser is great! My pores always shrink up after I use it. The wonder pore series has never failed me.,5
5637,"Does what it is advertised to do. It's not drying on my skin. FYI, I have dry/combination skin.",5
5638,"Love this product and its in my holy grail rotation.
Super hydrating for an emulsion, but truly helps my combo acne prone skin.",5
5639,Love this product.  Makes my skin feel smooth and clean.  I have noticed a change in my pores and breakouts.,5
5640,"Light scent, dries quickly yet maintains its moisture, and helps decrease pore size.",5
5641,This has my skin feeling clean and hasn't broken me out. I'm loving it!,5
5642,It wash such a good product. If I weren't broke I'd order more!,5
5643,My favorite face wash. I struggle with large pores and this has been the only face wash to minimize my large pores. I love it,5
5644,"one of the best face masks i own, i wish i could buy more",5
5645,This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used.,5
5646,"Smells good, feels good and makes me feel calm and happy.",5
5647,It is quite strong so I only use it once a week and always use a moisturizer afterwards.,5
5648,"These products felt nice on my skin and seemed good quality, but I saw no improvements in my pores and acne got mildly worse",3
5649,"Made my face very red afterwards and dry, I will try it a few more times to view more differences. Shipping and seller handling were great.",4
5650,"clean cleaner!!! excellent my wife made me use it and im telling ya, its better than any soap i,ve tried.",5
5651,"This stuff is magic, I'll never use another clay mask!",5
5652,Came at the beginning of the arrival date. The travel size pack is a great way to test several of the products. So far very satisfied!,4

5656,I love this necklace. I receive so many compliments!,5
5657,You have to have a small wrist to wear this.,3
5658,I didn't know that it was going to look so large. Disappointed!!!,1
5659,"Looks just like the picture... and really cute on! The pendant can be moved, which is a great feature. Love it!",5
5660,Nice designer necklace. Only thing cant get wet or will tarnish quickly,5
5661,"Stones very pretty, chain is very cheap looking. Doesn't do the heart justace",2

5663,This is my 2nd time ordering it because it is so cute.,5
5664,Was smaller than I expected but very nice necklace! Received plenty of compliments,4
5665,"For the price, the item is should have been much more sturdier.  Cheap looking.  Slightly disappointed.",3
5666,The latch comes broken and the necklace also did not look like what I saw. The quality is very poor.,1
5667,"This will definitely be in my yard sale this summer for a one dollar,  but I could easily but talked down to 50",1
5668,Thought  it would be cheap looking for the price but looks great . I love it,5
5669,"Was missing a stone when received,quality looks cheaper in person",1
5670,I also brought the matching bracelet! Love look and fit!,5
5671,Look like the picture got it as a gift for a friend she loved it,5

5673,Was not as shown or what I have bought in the past,1
5674,I really like this piece on. It's bulky but elegant at the same time.,5
5675,Clasp broke before I was able to wear it....no good,2
5676,Not as pictured its not the same as on the picture if you look closely the stones are to spaced out an on the pictures they are close,1
5677,"HUGE was looking for something a bit more subtle but that is on me the piece is flawless, great piece",4
5678,Soon as I took it out the package it came apart. Never worn.,1
5679,Very poor quality. Feels and looks like kids play jewelry.looks like it was spray painted!,1
5680,It was not real. It had a faded gold color.,1
5681,WoW ..I think its absolutely beautiful... some people want so much more than what they are paying  If you want high quality pay high quality,5
5682,Nice bling. L-o-l. It looks just as pretty in person. It's not heavy btw.,4
5683,Not long enough and too bright. Silver looks better.,3
5684,I love It!!!!!!!!!,5
5685,I loved the necklace online--but in person the chain looks cheap-almost like it's spray painted. At least I didn't pay a lot.,3
5686,I didn't expect it to be so big. Didn't really care for it.,1
5687,"The necklace was okay
I did not like the chain that was on it.",3
5688,The clasp was broke had to be replaced otherwise I like it,2

5730,I love this stuff. The smell is AMAZING! Purchased after getting a sample and will repurchase when I run out,5
5731,Expensive and does not moisturize hair. Hair looks frizzy even after I've sprayed it wet.,1

5743,Really makes your hair soft & helps restore it after all the blow-drying & other heat treatments.,5
5744,The price definitely makes me ssad. But this is the only leave in conditioner I've found that doesn't leave my hair greasy.,4
5745,I had gotten this in a product sample size and loved it - same here - works great!,5
5746,I bought the same exact product at Sephora and it had a completely different spray nozzle which leads me to believe this isn't the legit product.,1

5780,"Leaves my hair so soft, shiny, with a natural look and smelling great. Love it!",5
5781,"I honestly don't know where the good reviews come from, this did nothing for my hair and in fact made it brittle! I returned it.",1
5782,I love the smell.  I see absolutely no difference in the volume of my hair after using this product.  A waste of money for me.,3
5783,What everyone else said!  This stuff is amazing for my hair and the smell is subtle yet awesome!,5
5784,Makes your face feel like velvet but does not keep your make up on as long as others. Its o.k as a wrinkle filler,4

5790,"Arrived early, it works magic, fun and easy to use. Would make a nice gift.",5
5791,"It doesn't get very hot and didn't really curl my eyelashes.  My regular curler worked faster, better and is less expensive",2
5792,I don't think it curls very well...but it was worth a shot,2
5793,My regular lash curler works so much better. Waste of money.,1
5794,Horrible does not work do not waste your money it was a back-and-forth battle to get them to return this,1
5795,"Love using this....it's quick & easy, & makes a difference in my lashes",5
5796,Still can't open it to use it.. Such a waste,1
5797,Doesn't hold very well but i do like the brush,3
5798,This is a proven product based on my own wife's experience that is really a legit waterproof product :),5
5799,very good glue. sticks well. although it kinda just remains sticky. never bothers me though.,4
5800,"This glue is worthless, it never dries, its just sticky",1
5801,Love the black glue!! no more going over the white with eyeliner!,5
5802,"Probably the worst eyelash glue I have ever used, it took over 5 hours to even get tacky and was lumpy.",1
5803,"It's alright, weird nozzle though, you have to cut it open with scissors!",4
5804,Did not like this product at all. Very sticky and hard to use. I threw it away after a few tries.,1
5805,"Hard to take off even with warm water or make up remover .
Not the best",2
5806,love it.. got it late but works great and  a little goes a long way,5
5807,"Huge tube but its hardly full. It's deceiving like lays potato chips, mostly air in the package. But it does the job!",4
5808,The glue was open and unusable. Very disappointed with the purchase.,1
5809,It's a great product and I'd recommend anyone to use it.,5
5810,"Arrived early, It does the job,and it works very well  but the tube came almost completely empty,",2
5811,Great for my false lashes. I really like it.,5
5812,"Works, but barely any glue in there! All air and little bit of glue that's very messy. But cheap and works.",2
5813,Product wouldn't come out of the tube not sure if it is just old or too thick. Couldn't use it sorry.,3
5814,This eyelash was SO messy and got everywhere! It was really sticky and I can tell it would last long but it was just too messy for me,2
5815,Got here faster than i thought it would and works fine. Great product for the price :),5
5816,I was not disappoint when receiving the Banggood Waterproof Lady Girl For False Eyelashes Thank  you .. Amazon,3
5817,It takes forever to dry and the tube had barely any product in it.,1
5818,Works well even though my Dentist said not to put anything on the tongue.,5
5819,Completely different taste then the foam...not a fan.  Ick.,1
5820,"I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle, but the taste of this is just awful.",1
5821,"Bought 2 tubes, one had leaked when I opened the package, the other leaked after several uses. Don't waste your money on this item.",1
5822,Legit tongue cleaning option. I use it twice a day.,5
5823,"I prefer the tongue cleaner entitled ""Tung"" - I did not like this version at all.  UGH.",1
5824,An effective product which works as advertised. The foam version seemed to be more effective but that may be a personal bias.,4
5825,"The tube leaks, not happy about that! But the past itself is not terrible, the taste doesn't last that long though",3
5826,Seal at the top of tube broke and leaked blue gel.  Bad quality control.,1
5827,This is the bomb for helping keep the tongue clean after regular use the yucky white coating is gone.,5
5828,"Its good, but a tiny part of the tube ripped open when i was squeezing it to use it.",3
5829,I used to use this until I discovered the Tung brand.  Now I've switched as the Tung seems to work better for me.,2
5830,Very easy to use and we also had a wax warmer from gigi and it fit perfectly.,5
5831,"This was was awesome! Smelled great, applied smoothly, came off clean.",5
5832,I love this wax. It doesn't pull the skin like a lot of soft waxes can.,5
5833,it locks like it's true because someone wrote a review on it that proved that this is not a scam,5
5834,My 7 year old was VERY happy with the pack of cards. Great variety!,5
5835,Got full art kyogre in the 2 booster packs that came very happy,5
5836,"They are a gift for my grandson, he is just starting to collect these, I hope he likes them",4
5837,Pretty good just it took a month for it to ship,3
5838,great color and very durable.  My daughter really likes it for her phone.,5
5839,Exactly like the original one which I misplaced. What more can I say.,5
5840,Just exactly like the original. Put 2 AAA batteries in it and we were off and running.,5
5841,Got here before scheduled time in excellent condition worked perfectly thank you,5
5842,Quick delivery. Excellent quality. A little over priced.,4
5843,they are exactly what they say they are.  They are adequately sized and they are perfect for displaying your nail art :),5
5844,My daughter uses these to practice her nail art.  They are perfect for this.  This is the only thing she uses them for.,5
5845,very good product! I love it!! :-),5
5846,Good price and good quality. Haven't had any problems with them so far. Great for practicing nail art!,5
5847,Very useful when trying new nail designs to see what they will look like,5

6125,"Terrible product. It didn't work for longer than half a day, and the charcoal left a black/grey residue on EVERYTHING.",1
6126,I love this! Keeps my hair so fresh when I haven't washed it! :D,5
6127,I love this product.  It goes on easily and blends quickly.  My hair has more body.  The service was fast.,5
6128,Works great when you're on the go. The container is larger than it looks in the picture and will probably last me a while.,4
6129,Weird texture. Took too long to put on. Wound up throwing away as I like the spray ones better,3
6130,Great product. I do wish it came with a small applicator.,5
6131,gave as a gift the people were very happy with the product,5
6132,"these eos are great. all the flavors are awesome! very light and moisturizing, not goopy like other lip balms. highly recommend",5
6133,These are hard to find! So glad to get 'em. They are great. Kate,5
6134,"These ears are bigger than the cat ears by a little bit, still very adorable and cute.",5
6135,I loved this so much......my granddaughter  beat me for it.,5
6136,"I love this ankle bracelet.  It's shiny, dainty, and very pretty.  Del within time frame given.",5
6137,"5 stars for the product, great lipstick and wonderful color. However the vendor/transaction was 2 star at best. Delivery was super late...",3
6138,"Love this lip color, it goes on like a creamy matte",4
6139,Great color but it doesn't last as long as I wish it did.,3
6140,Not the color i expected but i have bought other colors from this brand and have no complains.,3
6141,Just received my lipstick in Alice it is very purple picture does not do it justice,5
6142,This is perhaps the worst Lewis lip color I have ever purchased. It cakes up almost immediately after application and peels off during the day.,1
6143,"Got Aurora, color is beautiful! Applied easy and lasted all Saturday night we are talking through bar hoping and a few vodka crans!!!!",5
6144,It feels very leathery when applied and is very difficult to get off. Not good.,2
6145,It's kinda drying God help you if you put too much on and don't forget to scrub your lips,3
6146,This matte metallic lippy stayed on for hours through eating and drinking. The formula is not drying on me and the color is sweeeeet!,5
6147,Absolutely love the color! Was very pleased! Will order again!,5
6148,the color is very nice but the product makes your lips feel odd and cakey,2
6149,"Only 3 stars because nice color, but never stayed on.  Not even a half hour.",3
6150,Pretty color but your lips feel super dry. I had to wear petroleum jelly on top which defeats the matte purpose.,3
6151,Not shiny like the photo at all. It stays on well but was looking for something that wasn't matte.,2
6152,Hated this product. it had a metallic smell and taste and was not what i expected. Won't be buying this anymore,1
6153,Nice color just disappointed not really a part of the Dia de los Muertos collection came with a plain silver cap,4
6154,I wanted to love it. The consistency is gross and it looks horrible on my lips.,1
6155,I love this but the color looks NOTHING like selling photo,3
6156,Love the color stays all day and not to drying on the lips one big problem was my cap didn't have the skulls,4
6157,"The color was a lot more shimmery and lighter than I expected. Wasn't the best color look on me, but excellent product",2
6158,My boyfriend loves this on me and he never notices my lipstick just beautiful.  However it is hard to remove.,5
6159,Loved it absolutely beautiful color I love LA splash Matt lipsticks,5
6160,I love this color! Very nice matte finish. Highly recommend this product. Can't wait to use a different color.,5
6161,It is so dry and makes my lips look all caked and cracky,1
6162,color is lighter and I did have to apply a few times a day,3
6163,"I didn't get belle, I got Hestia. But this color is still really really beautiful so I'm happy.",4
6164,Looks good when you first put on. Very dry and comes off in weird spots. It has a glittery look to it I wasn't expecting.,3
6165,Arrived in timely manner and girlfriend said this is best lipstick she's owned and loves the sparkles. So if she's happy I'm happy.,5
6166,"Love! Love! Love! This color.

Stays all day and looks beautiful. This is my every day color.",5
6167,Color is beautiful but it doesn't last long. Starts to cake amd crumble.,1
6168,Fast delivery but the actual product itself was subpar. It looks good for a few minutes but then it starts to cake and crumble.,1
6169,Had to wait forever to rec' but does a great job and easy to use.,5
6170,Kept falling out in all sizes but does change your nose shape nicely,3
6171,Scary to put in..ill just get a nose job in the future,1
6172,"They are all the same size, they are all mediums! You will get three sets of the mediums, thats why they won't work!",1
6173,"I didn't received, panDaDa 3 sizes per set nose.",1
6174,My middle school boys tried this (on just their bangs) repeatedly and it wore off/lost its hold after only an hour.,1
6175,My four year old grandson was delighted to have hair that stood up like the big boys.,5
6176,"Smells great, leaves my son's hair styled in place, but not sticky. I'd buy it again.",5
6177,"Great product! Got some for my 5 year old nephew who is very sensitive to most products, and it's perfect.",5
6178,"Awesome!  Perfect consistency, holds but not too sticky.  Found my go to product for my 3 little boys.",5
6179,"This item said it included a box of 10 blades once openings there was none available"" I ordered this to replace my old one",1
6180,Too light and can come apart while your using it. Very cheaply made.,1
6181,Had one before and lost it....so happy to be able to find another.,5
6182,"I just received today, which is a day earlier than expected shipping date. However, product was already broken. I am returning this product.",1
6183,"Nice results on wet hair, but the blades keep falling out! Just buy the name brand!",2
6184,"Love it nice and smooth on the hair depending on the length of tgim

 I just love it great tool to have",5
6185,"False. It only comes with two blade, the two that are inside. I will be returning.",1
6186,there was a mistake on packing some of these so if you did not get the blades call ShearsDirect.com at 888-436-1919 and they will mail you the blades.,5
6187,Great product and I especially appreciate the follow up to ensure that I received and have had no issues with my purchase!,5
6188,Great nail clipper I love the fact that when it is in the closed position it's so flat you hardly know it's in you pocket.,5
6189,"Very happy with the clippers, very small but when open not too small to use easily.  Good construction.",5
6190,Needs a lot of force to cut your nails. And it hurts the forcing hand when using it.,1
6191,"Works perfectly as a keychain clipper, snaps together well. Just what I was looking for to combat my constant hangnails. 10/10 would buy again.",5
6192,This is a great nail clipper and I love the slim design.  I recommend buying this clipper.,5
6193,The nail clippers are the best but only got one but was compensated for the other,3
6194,Great product and great company to deal with. Clippers really come in handy,5
6195,These are great to carry in a pocket.  Slim but functional.,5
6196,"Nice product, delivered on time. What more could you want.",5
6197,"The clippers themselves are great. Unfortunately, the keychain part has snapped off a couple times but it's fixable.",4
6198,Clippers are great key chain attachment not the greatest. Customer service is the best I have experienced on Amazon.,4
6199,These are the nicest clippers I own . The design is great no sharp edges to catch on your pocket . You need these !,5
6200,"Nice clippers, small profile.  The sellers helped solve a small issue.",5
6201,Very study and I feel that these clippers were built to last!,5
6202,I ordered the nail clippers as gifts for a family get together. The quality is very good. I would definitely order from the Product Shop again.,5
6203,"Could be a bit sharper, but very convenient.  Good value.",5
6204,"Warning: I did NOT receive a ""Pack of 2.""  I only received ONE item.",1
6205,"I only received 1 clipper, not the pair that I paid for. the sealed plastic bag had only one clipper in it.",1
6206,"Great quality, and and overall nice tool to have on a keychain.",5
6207,Only one came in not two. But I don't really care,3
6208,Good for making a boring plain outfit look cute! Great for creating an effortless outfit.,5
6209,It's cute....ok for what u pay for it.....,4
6210,It was too dark looks like it has been worn for years.,1
6211,Sorry .  Did not save product link of any of these beautiful necklaces.,5
6212,Bigger than expected. Chain Already begun to tarnish. Tried to send back. Seller won't acknowledge. Don't Buy!,1
6213,This necklace looks good paired with a solid colored shirt. I love elephants. The compliments just keep coming.,5
6214,I get so many compliments on it. It was just what I wanted.,5
6215,It is cute but I will never wear it it's a bit too large,4
6216,"I love elephants, and this necklace is quite a conversation piece!",5
6217,It was cheap looking and bigger than I thought it would be. Of course I only paid a dollar for it so what did I expect lol.,2
6218,way larger than i thought very nice item just a bit on the large side for me,3
6219,I got this for my mom but honestly I use all of these oils haha. I love the tea tree oil it gets rid of my acne quickly,5
6220,excellent aroma encont my girlfriend will not regret having made this gift,5
6221,This product more than met my expectations I am so glad I got it,5
6222,I really really wanted to live these products but I received broken bottles. very heartbreaking,2
6223,These oils may be from China with no info but these are quality oils. I would purchase again. Cannot beat the price.,5
6224,"For the price they are good.  Not the best quality oils.  No issues with seller, got everything in good time.",4
6225,"Loved them, used them for a trip to punta Cana, worked perfectly and its durable.",5
6226,"Really nice, looks real, lasts 2wks with proper care but hard to remove.
I recommend your best makeup remover after shower.",5
6227,No complaints. Looks exactly as advertised and is of great quality. I received several compliments.,5
6228,"look authentic, though one design looked tacky.  Lost lasting even in beach and pool water for 7 days.",4
6229,"Man these things are cool, I really look forward to using these in my photography work.",5
6230,WOW! I am super happy with these temp tattoos.  The images are incredible.  Definitely worth every penny.,5
6231,Looked awesomely real. Part of a sleeve I made for my halloween costume. Almost wanna get the real ones!,5
6232,I love love love these. Everyone thought these were real all night I got countless compliments,5
6233,"Beautiful tattoos, lasted a while when I put them on my outer forearm. Not too hard to get off, I would purchase these again.",4
6234,The tattoos are beautiful but did not come with application instructions.,4
6235,"It was great for the one week that it worked. But sadly, died after 7 days.",1
6236,Really love the way this cleans my face. My son and daughter use it as well and they love  it.,5
6237,"Love this cleansing brush. Bristles are perfect for cleansing, and don't hurt your face.",5
6238,Did not work at all. Would not turn on.,1
6239,Water went inside the battery area. Not waterproof at all.,2
6240,"Works great, easy to use, soft head which cleans gently, but efficiently. East to clean.",4
6241,The brush is waaaaaaay to soft how does it even clean anything i might as well have just used a wet cotton ball,1
6242,I liked the product but after two weeks water got to the inside and shorted it out. It was never in direct water spray or submerged,2
6243,Works well for safety but you can only get a a small size sip of fluid.,4
6244,This is very helpful as it controls the amount of fluid that can go in mouth with each sip.,4
6245,"Very good, moisturizing serum. I'm going thru my 4th bottle.",5
6246,Amazing product. Will be ordering muy second bottle next week.,5
6247,I used this product faithfully and did not see any growth AT ALL to my lashes.  Oh well!,2
6248,This product does not work. All it does is burn your eyes. In fact my lashes that I have are now thinned from using this product.,1
6249,I didn't see any improvement--so I went back to Latisse,2
6250,It  did not do much to thicken or lengthen my lashes!,2
6251,AMAZING. only been using for a few days and already notice a difference.,5
6252,I notice a little difference when using this product but nothing significant.,3
6253,It did not work for me. I really wanted it to work but it didn't.  I hope it works for everyone else,2
6254,Results are not the same as Latise`.  Seems to make existing lashes thicker after 4 weeks of use.,4
6255,"At first I was skeptical , after a few weeks to 5 weeks , I saw a difference!! I love it!!",4
6256,"Not seeing a huge difference. But yes, it is working a little bit.",3
6257,No progress noted even after 2 months of 2 x daily use.  Still continuing-,2
6258,It really does work just give it a few weeks.,4
6259,This product did not work at all for my wife.  It's name is very similar to a product that she had before that worked very well.,1
6260,I was surprised when I saw this for so cheap! It works great. My eyelashes are definitely longer and thicker.,4
6261,"Not only does it irritate if it gets in your eyes, I used for 2 months with no change at all.",1
6262,"did nothing for me so after a week and half,  i started morning and night very fateful, still nothing happen don't  waste your dollars",1
6263,It really works :) My toddler will finally let me brush her hair (sometimes).,5
6264,Love the hair brush... really works and my daughter doesn't fight me anymore when I'm brushing her hair..,5
6265,"Purchase for my daughter who hates brushing her hair. hopefully this will eliminate the drama, tears, and fussing that comes with brushing her hair.",5
6266,This brush is amazing! Takes out tangles with ease that conventional brushes would take more time.,5
6267,Great for my little one to brush her own hair.,5
6268,"Amazing product, good color. Only drawback is doesn't last all day.",4
6269,Not sure  I like this product.  I tried it once or twice and have not used it since.,3
6270,"Exactly as described, blends well, planning to order more. Much better than expected.",5
6271,I really have loved this product. I use it daily.,5
6272,Love how it looks .. does it's job!!,5
6273,I like the idea of a powder contour set. its easy to apply and it doesn't feel heavy on my face.,5
6274,I'm obsessed with this! Just awesome. Love the colors. Everything blends great.,5
6275,Beautiful!  Mine are powders not a cream.  Stays on all day,5
6276,HUGE pallete!!! Must buy!!!!,5
6277,Great product! Very happy with my purchase and will purchase more! However the power flakes off of brush very easy.,4
6278,Love it!!!! They do diminish with wear but live this product,5
6279,Got the results I desired for half the price of similar brand name products.,4
6280,I absolutely love love this this mascara. I have very thin eyelashes and when try this it gives my eyelashes beautiful.,5
6281,"Super awesome! I tried a friend's brand before, this one is better... Not as clumpy. Love it",5
6282,Cream works. Takes about 3 wks. to see results start.,5
6283,"Evened out my skin tone and lightened a bit, highly recommend, easy, a tiny drop in your moisturizer once a day
I ordered it twice",5
6284,Been using this product for a month now and have not seen any change with my melasma. It was a waste of money.,1
6285,"If you really need to lighten freckles or dark pigmentation, use cream with 4% Hydroquinone",1
6286,have been using for a solid month 1/2 and no improvement in freckles. stinks really bad too. won't be buying again,1
6287,Gave me red bumps. Bad product. Didn't work and caused red bumps.,1
6288,"very small container for like 4 or 5 uses only. compared to others in market ( 60 ml bottle), this product isn't a match.",1
6289,Good product great price was received late because ended up in wrong city by usps,5
6290,These are number one for getting a close shaved head.,5
6291,Great product. Wore it for the July 4th bbq. I would recommend it.,5
6292,Very pleased with the quality. My only regret is not ordering two so I don't have to share!,5
6293,Nice headband fit well and the colors are very rich and vibrant,5
6294,Super cute! Can't wait to wear this for the Fourth of July.,5
6295,Not worth the $5. Invest in something better quality. Cheap fabric that slides and won't stay on,1
6296,Very cute and decent quality but will not stay put on my head.,3
6297,Can't wait to wear this at Faster Horses Festival in Brooklyn Michigan!,5
6298,Way too big. It falls right off of my head. I thought it may be me so my friends tried as well and had the same issue,1
6299,Wife loves this item - I've ordered her just the lotion the second time around.,5

6307,The Day creame was only partly full and the night creame only half full,1
6308,"Boots no7 works great. Love this product, would recommended it to anyone.",5
6309,This is a wonderful product. Ive used the makeup for several years and now the skin care. I like the fact  that its made in England.,5
6310,These work better than most but still doesn't do everything they claim.,4
6311,Totally AWESOME!!  Immediately noticed the difference!  Have a new face now!,5
6312,This is the worst price a available for this item. You can get the exact kit in Ulta for $69.99,1
6313,Been using for several months.  I love the way this product makes my skin feel.,5
6314,"This is a bit expensive for no noticeable improvement in my wrinkles, small or otherwise.  Have used it for several months but will not be reordering.",3

6320,"So far, like this product.  Must use more religiously to determine effectiveness.",4
6321,One of the items was not as described. Took FOREVER to receive!,1
6322,This feels like high end department store lotion. Smells great. My skin is super sensitive and I had no problems.,5

6324,"my wife likes this stuff, she says it works. i think it is overpriced but if it works for her it works for me.",4

For the price, this is a great value.
You get the Day, Night and Serum!",5

6338,This was a pricey product and wasn't as hypo-allergenic as I needed. Sent this product back.,1

6341,love No. 7 and everything about all their products!,5

6349,"Love Boots No7  products. Does what it says.
The only thing I didn't like it went up $10 after I ordered it!!",5

6351,Used for several weeks with no noticeable difference in skin.  Does not absorb well.,3
6352,My wife loves it. I end up buying the Protect & Perfect Intense Advanced Serum (30 ml / 1 Oz) more often for her.,5
6353,Smooth on face this is second one by no. 7,5

6403,It was the first time in  years my teeth felt really clean.  The gums began improving almost immediately too!,5
6404,"The best natural toothpaste on the market, effective and you will won't be able to go back to another brand when the little tub is empty.",5

6409,"My six year old loves to wear this, it doesn't hurt her head like some others and she can wear it with so many different outfits",5

6422,"Nicely packaged but the color was not what I was expecting. Sadly returned, but I would consider buying again if there were more colors.",3

6425,"great hair, just didn't fit my color arrangement...",5
6426,Not what I excepted.  Looks like a toy hair piece.,3

6481,Super comfy! It dries fast so it doesn't smell musty and the suction cups don't slip.,4
6482,Is cushiony but suction cups need improvement. Very difficult to get to stick to tub. Have to really press hard.,3

6492,"Suction kinda sucks, but it does dry well and is comfy.",5
6493,My wife loved it! Great gift for Mother's Day!,5
6494,Got this for lower back support in the tub. Suctions stay on so pillow stays in place. Drip dry by auctioning to bathtub wall.,5
6495,"Way too hard, does great not holding the water, but is not at all comfortable.  Don't waste your money!",1
6496,"This was a replacement for one I wore out. Comfortable, wears well, stays put on tub, easy clean.",5
6497,not at all super soft. the suction cups do not hold to the tub.,1
6498,Had to return. On one side the seam was not sealed. Replaced with a totally different type.,1

6506,"Love this cushion, it makes my bath much more luxurious. Very comfortable and attached to my tub well with the suction cups.",5

6512,Nice ample sized brush.  Easy to get a hold of.  Soft bristles.  Thanks!,5
6513,Great brush...very dense bristle base.  Great for contouring cheek bones.,5
6514,Great brush for contour. Blends well and easily. No shedding. Smelled like paint when it first arrived but that quickly faded.,5
6515,"I think sometimes the brush comes out too blunt. I am still trying to master it, was so cheap its worth it!",4
6516,Perfect contour brush! I've been using it daily for over a month and love it! Much better than many of the expensive brushes I own!,5

6520,I love them i wish they had other ones or basic sharingan,5
6521,Arrived when expected. Correct product. Design is clear on each piece. Sized as listed in description. Box doubles as storage - bonus.,5
6522,There okay. I should have paid closer attention to the diameter. Little too large in scale for a 9 year old.,3
6523,Love the earrings wish there was seven instead of six pairs but still love them,5
6524,Everyone that knows anime sees them right away and loves them. The people that don't ask if they are lady bugs...,5

6526,These earrings are perfect. They look amazing and they're just the right size.,5

6536,"Love them- slightly bigger than expected and one separated from the earring backing when I pulled it too hard, but still good.",4
6537,"Stems are long, they don't rust or tarnish. But they do however need a cleaning every now and again.",5
6538,Awesome! I wear them out all the time! I just got an Itachi Uchiha hoodie and it's a great match!,5
6539,"Excellent quality, love it's shine as well.  Would highly recommend this item.",5
6540,not even worth $3 and i paid $10. there size is smaller than a penny WTF!,1

6542,"Quality was not as good. Then again, it's for cosplay.",3
6543,It is broken. Due to the cheap price. I won't return it.,1
6544,"it's hard to open on first time. I have to use both my hand and my teeth.
But the lipstick its good to use.",4
6545,Great color! Lasts a long time on the lips. Arrived quickly,5
6546,"The person who loaded the goods, is your head used to increase the height? Why only four lipsticks, I obviously bought five.",1
6547,"Very nice color, lot better than I Thought . Good buy!",5
6548,I would definitely buy this again!  Great color and doesn't dry out my lips.,5
6549,I got this because it is on the Environmental Working Group's list of lead free lipsticks.  Love it!,5
6550,"I love it! very nice sheen and durability, too!",5
6551,This is a great red lipstick. The color is great and I am happy with the lipstick.,5
6552,"creamy, smells good but you must make yourself enough to see the intense color",5
6553,very sheer and more pink than red but for 82 cents you can't complain.,4
6554,It's a tube of lipstick not much to say. Came in the shade I needed and shipped quickly.,5
6555,It's the right color red and I loooove it great lipstick,5
6556,Good color. But I don't really like the smell,4
6557,NOT RED. This is a really bright pink. I was very disappointed.,2
6558,"It's a nice color, but it's kinda transparent. They accidentally shipped 3 tubes instead of 1, but I'm not complaining.",3
6559,The color is definitely not a hot red or even a true red. It goes on pink.,3
6560,Best scents ever...and they're clean with minimal chemicals as well as vegan!!! Yay!,5
6561,Feminine flowery smell but not too strong. Love this!,5
6562,I love this thing. I finally feel like I don't need to hide my loofah to keep my man card.,5

6566,Bought as a gift and I was told they loved it.,5
6567,Love the length and how easy that makes it to use.,5
6568,This product works as advertised. My issue is that it does not create a good lather with body wash like a traditional loofah.,3
6569,Not what I expected from the source material...a waste of money.....gb,2
6570,"Much to rough for this 70 year old back.  However, I might find some use for it removing bark from trees.",2
6571,"I feel clean, secure, your product does a good job, thanks.",5

6574,"It's early yet, but it gets to places on my back that I can no longer reach.",4

6576,"I purchased this for my husband, he said he likes it thank you!  He said it works just fine  :)",4

6581,My husband and I love it...I will purchase another,5

6588,"Works very well, still holding up more than a year later.",5
6589,"So far love it only used twice,will write another review after I use it more.",5
6590,Lasted a whole 2 weeks before starting to tear. Threw it out,1
6591,I love this scrubber!  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Quality is great and I thought the price was good.,5
6592,My son likes it. He said it feels smooth and doesn't scratch his skin.,5
6593,Wasn't really what I was looking for. I'm going to look into something a bit more user friendly.,2

6598,Durable and effective.  I bought one for travel and later I bought one for home.,5
6599,This is a great product to wash/exfoliate the backside  after shoulder surgery.,5
6600,"works well, not overly scratchy.  slightly awkward to use, but they're all like that.",5
6601,Meh it does what it should but nothing special. In retrospect I would have probably been happier with the handle type loofah.,3

6603,Happier with this than with any brush I've ever owned....does a good job washing my back!,4

6609,Nice quality. Plenty long. Good price. Did just perfect as intended.,5

6612,I bought this for my dad and he loves it. I will be ordering him a few backups.,5
6613,"Just what I wanted,loofah pad is a nice size , rope handles work well  Price was very good. Thanks",4
6614,The loofah and cloth are too different in flexibility as materials and you're not able to get a good scrub after a couple of uses.,2
6615,My husband has a hard time reaching his back due to shoulder issues. This loofah is the perfect solution! It works great.,5
6616,"Used this for 4 months, very satisfied.  Recommended.",5

6652,Throw your back brush away. This thing is amazing!,5
6653,The Loofah is not thick enough to get the job done; a brush/Loofah on a long handle would be better,3

6724,They are easy to put on as you are walking out the door and keep the mosquitos away.,5
6725,not a bad product.  super inexpensive and many came with the purchase.  would buy again.,4
6726,These bracelets did help with repelling bugs. I just really do not like the citronella smell.,4
6727,We have only once so far but they seemed to work well,4

6738,"Didnt really like this it not good

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review",1
6739,Packing was good. Use to protect from mosquito bites when your kids plan to play outdoor and while doing gardening work in late evening.,4
6740,Worked great the first 20 mins or so. Then just on the arm it was being worn on . Other arm got bit up!,3
6741,Works great. Haven't seen one mosquito flying around when wearing the bracelet. All natural ingredients work great for my girlfriend who is pregnant.,5

6748,it works ok but might only last about 6 hours each bank you have on,3

6750,I recived this product with discount. It arrived fast and it smell good.,5
6751,my girls are over joyed. every spring they get eaten by mosquitoes. I put these bracelets on them..wow no bites,5
6752,"Completely bogus, useless product. Does not work at all. Mosquitoes actually seemed to be attracted to them.",1
6753,This just made me smell like citrus. I didn't notice any difference after pitting this on.,1
6754,My kids are allergic to mosquitoes and these bracelets in combination with some other products do the trick and keep them bite free.,5
6755,These are great. They do work but for not as long as the seller's claim.,4
6756,"These work but you have to wear one on your ankle and wrist to really get some coverage, otherwise those pesky mosquitoes will eat your legs up.",5
6757,"These are so cool and they smell like citronella candles,  no bites at all",5
6758,Worked great.  comfortable.  non offensive smell and durable.  Highly recommend this company.,5
6759,works as intended but put on before you get bitten.  I tend to forget that part,4
6760,We have tried once with these bracelets and it may not work well since we all got quite some mosquito bites,3
6761,Not sure that these actually worked but the kids loved wearing them!,3
6762,Did not work in the Florida Everglades and I had one on each wrist and one on each ankle.,1

6764,"can wear on wrists or ankles, even around your neck!",5
6765,I live in south Florida where the mosquitoes are thick in the summer time.  This Bracelet keeps them off you.  very good product,5

6767,This product does not work and keeps slippng off kids hands,1
6768,They don't repel much. Still got bit by mosquitoes  and had bees landing on it,1

6770,Or doesn't work on south fl type of mosquitoes :/,2
6771,These bracelet are great! Can tie it anywhere! It works really great!,5
6772,Nice packaging but these things don't work! I got bit in Hawaii regardless of how many of these i wore.,2
6773,You probably need to wear a couple of them at the time to see a result,2
6774,I put 4 of these on and the mosquitoes could care less!,2
6775,Not sure it is effective.  I will not purchase again.,3
6776,They seem to work for the kids.  That's good enough for me.,4

6783,"the product looks nothing like picture. plus, it comes in packs of one, not five.",1
6784,Didn't work for us. I wish they had.,1
6785,Mosquito seems to love it. I was covered with bites after going outside with my new bracket. Very disappointed in it.,1
6786,They work great and can be used on your ankle too. You can double wrap on little wrists.,5
6787,"Worked great, no smell, didn't get bit once",5
6788,Smell was way too strong and gave my daughter and I a rash.,1
6789,They seem to work okay ... they just get a little itchy after wearing for awhile.,3
6790,Mosquitoes love this. It's a total west of money.,1
6791,"One is not strong enough to work successfully, but wearing one on each wrist and ankle works great!",4
6792,"On day 3, there was a mosquito on my knee while I had the bracelet on my ankle only inches away...",2
6793,"Seemed to work really well on our camping trip to Twin Lakes, Mammoth. Just a few bites which is a great win - mosquitoes love me.",4
6794,"I wore one on wrist, one on ankle, but I got bites on arms and legs. Not effective in my experience.",2
6795,"They worked but very flimsy, and do not last as long as other bands.  For the amount of bands and price they are ok.",3
6796,Doesn't work. I got a mosquito bite 3 inches next to the bracelet.,1
6797,These did not work. I had a bracelet on each arm during my hike and I still ended up with 16 bites.,1

6799,It doesn't repel mosquitoes at all.  They land right next to it.,2

6818,it does work! wow! will buy more for my entire family!,5
6819,Works great especially for those who don't like the spray.  Just need to remember to return it the pouch when not in use.,4

6961,This product is awesome! Very easy to use.....just don't let it accidentally spill in your filing cabinet at work,5
6962,Great for Halloween and theatre effects. Does have an ammonia odor that goes away when it dries but that's expected.,4
6963,"Bought This and it was my first time ever using latex or fx products, easy to work with!",5
6964,"love the effects that this offers.  In the photo I only used professional makeup, couple different consistencies of fake blood, and the latex.",5
6965,First time using liquid latex.  Worked great for attaching a bald cap and I have enough for the next 10 halloweens at least.,5
6966,AWESOME ... I retract my previous post - Product received - AWESOME,5
6967,"Was what we needed, and not crazy over priced.",5
6968,"Product is exactly as advertised! It works perfectly, I will buy it again when I finish mine :) it arrived on time!",5
6969,Its the only latex ive used i buy it because its reasonable and gets the job done,4
6970,Worked great for my wife's project recreating some face make up for halloween.,5
6971,This was bought for my granddaughter. She made some very life like gashes and monster faces. She loved this product. Easy to use.,5
6972,You won't regret it you can do any wound with this latex!!,5
6973,"Awesome
Love the product
Super easy to use and made me look great on Halloween!",5
6974,"Loved this, just don't get into hair, it does give off a strong glue smell",5
6975,It's hard to use and gets everywhere.  better off using the Ben Nye Nose and Scar Wax for gashes or cuts.,2
6976,"This stuff came chunky and the lid leaked everywhere. When I tried to use it, it immediately coagulated. I would not purchase again.",1
6977,A lot of product and worth the price I purchased for 12 the only this it has a weird smell but all latex does .,4
6978,my fx makeup loving daughter will love this for Christmas.,5
6979,Definately worked for what i needed it for. Scary clown makeup! Lasted for hours and worked perfect!,5
6980,"good latex, the smell is always weird but it does it purpose",5
6981,Even though it works (kinda) this product was not great. The liquid latex was way too watery.,1
6982,"I am thinking about buying this for next Halloween, Does it stain clothes?",4
6983,This product is very thin. Tkaes a while to dry.,3
6984,"In no way a professional, so this is great for me.",4
6985,"Not thick enough, takes too long to dry. Stick with Ben Nye brand",2
6986,It really works as it should. Very easy to handle and the smell wasn't too bad.,5
6987,Daughter wanted to use this for Halloween effects. Worked great in her trials and was much cheaper than at the Halloween store.,5
6988,"I love this product, it drys very fast, and looks real",5
6989,"I think this product is great. The only problem with it is, it's hard to take off.",4
6990,Mostly just runs down.  So watery as to be useless,3
6991,This stuff works great for dead flesh effects. It definitely smells bad but it's great.,5
6992,Awesome product! Worked excellent with the custom Predator dreads I made. Dried really quick and has a great feel when it's finished.,5
6993,it comes on clear and the quality of the latex unlike others i've had is amazing... im looking forward to halloween this year XD,5
6994,They fit all my big bottles from various brands and work great!,5
6995,"They were a little bit hard to ""undo"" in order to pump them. But, seem like they are decent quality.",4
6996,"The kids love the ""bouncy balls""! Hours of entertainment! Thank you!!",5
6997,"Easy to install, easy to use. Good plastic.",5
6998,Fit perfectly on the Surface liter bottles. They seem long so hopefully these will be able to get that last little bit of the bottle.,5
6999,"Put this pump on our kids shampoo bottles so they wouldn't waste it.  Works great, don't have to buy shampoo as often.",5
7000,Fit my Paul Mitchell Shampoo One and The Conditioner perfectly.,5
7001,Very impressed with this product! Fits perfectly on my 33 oz bottles of Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner. Great quality :),5
7002,Is not a universal size! Bought it for a gallon container and it was too small. Sent it back and they never gave me a refund!,1
7003,"I have liter bottles of kerastase shampoo and conditioner, and these do not fit. They are too long.",1
7004,The stem is too short. Only about 6 inches long. Otherwise it was fine,3
7005,They are to short for the large bottle.  About 1 inch short.,2
7006,"Got these for my liter of shampoo and conditioner.  Works great, no problems with these at all.  I would highly recommend.",5
7007,Just what I needed for my larger size shampoo bottle.,5
7008,This is a very nice pump. Good quality and fits my 33.8 oz shampoo bottle well.,4
7009,"Great pumps that fit the tresemme bottle I needed it for. Good price and was able to cut length and use on shorter bottle, too.",5
7010,Too short of a tube to even reach half way down a 1 liter bottle: useless.,1
7011,I bought these for my Enjoy liter bottles and then put them in my AG bottles.  They fit perfect and work well.,5
7012,Really like these pumps.  So much nicer than lifting the liter bottles every time I wash my hair.,5
7013,Was hard to get started at first but has worked every time.  Arrived in a timely matter.  Would recommend.,4
7014,Love these. They fit perfect on my 32 oz shampoo and conditioner bottles.,5

7032,The earrings turn green and look very old. Will not buy again.,2
7033,The items glued onto the back aren't even glued in straight.  These are the cheapest-looking earrings I've ever seen! Extremely disappointed!,1

7044,Cute earrings.  I will be wearing them as very casual jewerly,4
7045,"Like the earrings very much,just a little difficult to put on since there are 3 pieces to them,but still like them",4

7121,The smell of this product is horrendous. I can't use the product because of the stench.,2

7246,Best purchase ever! Saves me a trip to the nail salon.,5
7247,works as stated. but wish i would have gotten one at the store so i could buy replacement parts easier,4
7248,Bought this less than a year ago and it won't charge when plugged in. When it was new it worked well.,1
7249,Charger fall apart after month and before the charger fell apart the device stopped charging. just purchase the AMORE.,2
7250,Doesn't work well on significant calluses but works well for maintenance once those are removed with a manual file,4
7251,Battery failed to charge/stay charged after 6 months of use.,1
7252,Awesome safe and easy to use. Best callus remover ever used.,5

7257,"I like it, I use it along with my callus remover and I now have smooth skin.",4

7259,"My bridesmaid disclosed this information, we both retrieved benefits.",4
7260,Much better than the old fashion egg shaped scraper.  My wife and I both like this product.,5
7261,Won't charge. Says to charge 8 hours but won't take it or hold it.,1

7267,Love this product!!!!! Saves money on pedicures,5
7268,I love this! It works great and I use it on a regular basis.,5

7270,"works great, make sure you use it right out of the shower for best results, and remember not to leave it on your skin too long.",4
7271,Love this product!  It smoothed the calluses on my feet right down and made my feet soft and smooth. AAA++++,5

7273,Doesn't seem to take care of the callus removal but good idea product.,3
7274,Works great took off dead skin fast. You need to go over area several times,4

7294,This is ok. Takes time to remove callus. Not so effective as I expected,3
7295,I like it. It really works takes the dead skin off,4
7296,great product! it could use more power but for the size and price it does what it needs to do pretty well.,5
7297,Works excellent. Way better than paying for a pedicure. Have used many times and haven't had to change roller.,5
7298,"results were immediate --  no sores, smooth head not to mention great packing
good find for me :)",5
7299,I'm not a fan . It doesn't really seem to remove any calluses. I used it a few times and didn't see any results,2

7315,This works really well! My fiance loves this too!,5
7316,"Really good product if you have fairly soft feet. Guess i needed more like a sander for my
Jacked up feet.",3
7317,Great tool to have for your feet. It did not try in on wet feet but on try it got the job done very well,4
7318,The battery on it is terrible. The battery only lasts a few minutes. Do not buy! I'm very disappointed.,1
7319,Works as advertised. Has plenty of power and I was able to smooth out my calloused heals.,5
7320,Works ok. You have to find a balance on how hard you can push and it still spin.,4
7321,"Works great, if you let the remover do the work.  Just don't try to press down too much.  LOVE it!",5
7322,I am surprised by how cheaply it is made. The cord came apart after using it a couple times to charge the device.,1
7323,Does a fair job. The trick is to use it frequently,4
7324,"works great. take your time,do some every day.",5
7325,It does what it says it will do. My feet are very soft. I am glad I bought this.,5

7332,Love this little machine!  Works wonders on my feet and calluses on my hands too!,5
7333,"Does a good job.  I think that people that complain that it stops when you push, are not using it properly.",5
7334,Works great and is powerful. Just wish the charge lasted a little bit longer,5
7335,Take it slow because it takes some skin off fast. So love this product and can't believe I've waited this long to have one.,5
7336,I have major calluses!!!  This Product took 2 sessions to make a major impact on my feet!!  Thank You!,5
7337,"No batteries to change, no slowing down, smooth heels.  What more could a lady want?",5
7338,"Seems to be doing the job so far. Hope it holds up for awhile, at least long enough to justify the purchase.",4
7339,This works better than I though it would. Love it.,5
7340,"could use a little more power, but overall it does what it says",3
7341,I bought this for my husband and he likes it.  It works great and does the job.,5

7366,Works good and washes off easily. Oh and the price is better than other products. Highly recommend.,5

7370,Best hair product ever.  One jar last me 4 to 5 months.,5

7379,It is a good product if you like gel nail polish if you it has fun designs and it easy after a while just take practice.,5

7398,"Had a problem that the seller fixed right away, this little set is amazing.  Glad to have it!",5
7399,This set is great. I take it everywhere. Super handy./,5
7400,Tiny and cheap quality. Would NEVER BUY AGAIN. Instruments don't work well,1

7430,beautiful set . excellent for travel. the nail clippers are a bit small but is a great set for travel,4

7447,I feel like it washed out already and it's only been 4 weeks,3
7448,Love this keratin. Works well and doesn't smell bad!,5

7458,Easily smoothed out my feet.  Love it and will be buying again when needed.,5
7459,Doesn't work well on water. Looses its coarseness and I haven't had it for long plus you get inidated with emails which is annoying,1
7460,Works good enough. Kind of large and can't get to smaller ares in middle of ball of foot where calluses are worse.,3
7461,Good quality.  Good price.  Arrived quickly.  Easy to handle during use. Like that it is dual-sided - coarse and regular.,4

7471,No need to be a nail artist to use these!  Great results.,5
7472,Only one strip included in the package. Not worth the trouble.,1
7473,"I love using these on my nails. Clean lines, not messy",5
7474,very tiny strips so be patient but when you are done it looks fabulous,5
7475,these vinyls work great an always give me a nice clean peel and look great in instagram videos (@nailsby.abbie),5
7476,I love these!! They are so easy to use and sooo cute!! Strongly recommend,5
7477,its cute but a little too expensive for a small sheet,3
7478,Won't stay on nails when trying to use them. Can't get them on good enough to paint over it. Just cheap. Waist of money,1
7479,"Received but not colored, just white. Not what I had expected.",2
7480,"I've tried this over and over, but I can't get a defined line.",1
7481,They are easy to use and are quite durable. I love doing nail art and these are perfect!,5
7482,Not worth the money. Sticker peels off the nail polish when removed.,1

7488,Only thing is that it's a heavy piece but very beautiful,4
7489,This crown looks very pretty in actual. Stones are complete and well intact. I am so glad that it has been delivered on time.,5
7490,Broke as soon as I put it on. Not that shiny,1
7491,sparkly hairband. Its beautiful but its little tight for my 6 years old girl,4
7492,Beautiful....exceed my expectations. Well made and sparkly... Looks very expensive...love it,5
7493,"I have seen others for 5 times the price that were not as nice, I love it.",5
7494,Beautiful but way too small. It is extremely tight and uncomfortable on the average head size.,2
7495,Stones were a lose and had to glue them before wearing them.,2
7496,Super cute real shiny love it! But when I put it on a section of the bling piped off.,2
7497,I love it!! It looks absolutely gorgeous!! Came faster than expected. I definitely recommend!!,5
7498,The smell is incredibly strange but the color is beautiful! Definitely more brown hued than the picture,5
7499,"Beautiful color and long lasting , don't use on chapped lips though it looks flakey and just unpleasant.",5
7500,It's great the only thing wrong is it smells a bit weird sort of like Clorox.,5
7501,Love how it stays on all day. Don't have to keep applying more lipstick through out the day. Will order more.,5
7502,Just what I wanted at the price I was willing to pay.,5
7503,Absolutely love these nail files. They arrived in perfect condition and are the best files I have used to date.,5
7504,Can't say anything bad about the glass file. The knockoffs are much thicker and rough. This is a great buy and a great price.,5
7505,My order arrived as described. It's just what I was looking for!,5
7506,"These work great.
No more finding the wet cardboard based files on countertops.
Different sizes for home, office etc.
Very pleased.",5
7507,"well packaged, beautiful files - used on my natural nails and plan to use pedicure file on my dogs' nails!",5
7508,These files are awesome! They don't chew up the edges of the nail. Always a smooth finish.,5
7509,Love these files.  Much better than the paper or drug store ones you buy. Less breakage on nails as well.  Also great for the heels.,5
7510,The absolutely best fingernail file I have ever used (and this is from a 76-year man)!,5
7511,These work great. I keep one in my purse one at home and one at work. I gave one away as a gift.,5
7512,Excellent nail files.  Very happy I purchased these.  Would definitely purchase again - plan to give as gift also.,5
7513,"I bought the set to have a couple of extras about the house for the broken nails I get, which can shred cloth if not filed down.",5
7514,Damn good price for all these filers. I'm not sure what the round one is for.,5
7515,These are beautiful and work perfectly! So happy!!,5
7516,"Nice pieces great quality, delivery prompt. Would like a mini case for it though... I will find one.",4
7517,"These are gorgeous and work great!  I love that there are enough for me to leave at home, at work, and in my car!",5
7518,Looooooovvvveeeee THIS PLATES THIS IS THERE BEST STAMPING PLATES!!!!,5
7519,These stamps are so shallow that the stamper can't grab the image. I'm very disappointed in this product.,1
7520,"They work ok, but some of the designs are not as clear as others when you stamp them.",3
7521,The plates are good but the stamper doesn't work very well.,4

7523,They are really great! Buy they are a little to big!,4
7524,This is our third cici & sisi set and as usual the plates are excellent.  They stamp clean crisp images.  I would buy again.,5

7548,I liked this product. The results are very good.,5
7549,"My 2 month old son has eczema on his face, this aloe vera gel soothes his eczema on his face!! Highly recommend it",5
7550,Poor and a complete joke.  They tarnished after ONE DAY.  Don't waste your money.,1
7551,They are so small. I wish I had check the size.,5
7552,This item was smaller than I expected it to be but it still does the job. Shipping was fast too,4
7553,Disappointed in the size. But that's definitely might fault for not checking the dimensions of the product. I assumed they were going to be bigger,3
7554,They looked bigger than they actually were. A bit Misleading,2
7555,The dappen dishes that I received do work fine; however they look nothing like the picture that is advertised.  I am disappointed.,2
7556,"It came on time , but they are small, but good",4
7557,it was SUPER SPARKLY and they did not rally match my skin tone.,3
7558,"Shipped quickly and wasn't broken.  But it's dark red, not black at all.",1
7559,Was cracked and broken and took the lid off and the lipstick fell out! Terrible quality never buying it again! Very cheap!,1

7561,I love seeing this necklace sparkle on my wife's neck.. it's beautiful & I love the idea of a jem floating inside a cube.. amazing.,5
7562,"Looks larger on the picture. The only reason I didn't return, did not pay much for it. Should show actual size.",2
7563,the chain was to short to wear with. it really does not tell you the size. I put it on a different chain,4
7564,Very pretty necklace. Can't wait to wear it. Thanks. Laura.,5
7565,"It's super cute, but the chain broke. Not a problem, I just replaced the chain. The pendant is lovely.",4
7566,Really nice piece and what a deal!!! Worth every bit!! Much nicer quality than expected.,5
7567,It's lovely. You can't beat the price.,5

7569,A cute necklace for my daughter. She's in love with jewelry and wears this ofte.,5

7573,"It doesn't hold my hair in place after I close it, so as i'm cutting my hair it moves and I cut it crooked.",2
7574,"Medal hinge wasn't set, and I couldn't fix.",3
7575,"This item works and is much cheaper than a certain brand.  Overall, very satisfied with this purchase.",5
7576,So easy to trim my bangs and hair now!!,5
7577,Construction is cheap. Function is awkward.  Directions in foreign language.  Took forever to receive.,1
7578,Couldn't use it because it didn't clamp  down on my hair.  Just slid off. Cheap Chinese copy.,1
7579,They work well.  Wish it was a little better made.  don't think it will last long term.,5
7580,The clip didn't open properly. The closing clasp won't move. It is not a good buy unfortunately,1
7581,Does it exactly the way its shown on TV works great,4
7582,"Does the job! No instructions included, so watch videos online for the creaclip.",4
7583,This was one of the most useless products I have bought.  It wouldn't stay in her hair so I could cut it.,1
7584,They're cheap but work great. No more spending money for hair cut any more. Love them!!!,5
7585,"worked good for my husbands haircut, but not for mine",4
7586,Product was as described and saved me a trip to the store.,4
7587,Super amazing! I love it. Cutting my own hair is no longer rocket science,5
7588,No instructions whatsoever. I honestly have not even tried them yet,3
7589,Really easy to use. Seems to be exactly the ones that cost 6x as much. Arrived in good time from china,5
7590,The open close  clip would not open. Forcing it would have broken it. Very cheaply made.,1
7591,"It slides right out of my hair but not the fault of the product, I just have really soft, fine hair.",4
7592,Save your money and buy the real deal.  Cheaply made.,1
7593,Love it! Works GREAT I'll use it forever!!!!,5
7594,It's OK if you don't be very careful you can get a bad cut. The level is off my hair was cut uneven.,3
7595,i love the product.now i can do layer cut of my own .its really good...it reached me early .,4
7596,Its a little harder to use than advertised. but its ok when you have help.,3
7597,For the price it's worth it. I tried it and my layers are amazing. I will be buying more as a gift.,5
7598,I purchased this product all the time but this particular batch leaves a white film  no matter what amount used,1
7599,Horrible product. Made my skin irritated. Did not do anything for me. Would like my money back.,1
7600,"Love this under eye firmer, no residue and it lasts all day long",5
7601,"Only problem is having to be very careful putting on, or it will turn white.",4
7602,Not as good as other skin tighteners I have used.,2
7603,This stuff works really well but you must not apply it too heavily and be sure to shake it up.,5
7604,Too oily. it would probably be  great if it weren't so oily and just smeared everywhere,2
7605,Great product! Great price! Wish i bought 5 at a time!!!! Going to reorder more.,5
7606,The delivery was late but the product is good. It matches my skin tone and Iam happy with it.,4

7609,Solid product for the price! Very basic but you can apply however you need to get the look you want.,4
7610,Very cute but I wish it would show up a little better.,3
7611,It was a good idea but the stick doesn't work as good as hoped.,2
7612,It is just OKAY I don't like it too much but it's fine I guess,3
7613,Got it half melted and was so much lighter so this i a big no all around!!!,1
7614,"It's streaky and took off my foundation, however it was a great eye primer made my eyeshadow stay on for hours.",3
7615,It's soft and the shimmer is great but it came broken so I was kind of disappointed,4
7616,It's kinda chunky and it barely has any shimmer at all.,2
7617,These are surprisingly good for how inexpensive they are. Love to even use as a cream eyeshadow.,5
7618,Love this stuff! Works great & is the best for its price. I will be ordering more!,5
7619,I wear this right above my cheek bones. I am about Halle Berry's complexion if this helps you.,5

7621,It came really early and it looks so pretty and natural,5
7622,It's so adorable and the shimmer pigment is great I love it,5
7623,"Although shipping took about a month, I am satisfied with this product. It applies very easily and it gives off an amazing sparkly glow!",4

7627,Great face highlighter. It stays on all day. Love it!,5
7628,Works great. Adds a shine to my 70 year old face. Love the fact that it is waterproof.,5
7629,Its TINY. Yet it is a beautiful color and shimmer.,4
7630,This is beautiful and can be users for so much more than highlights. My daughter loves it as eyeshadow,5
7631,I love this highlighter.  It stays on and shines perfectly. I will DEFINATELY buy again,5
7632,"It's a bit oily, buy looks nice and a great price compared to similar items",4
7633,Super pretty and easy to apply! Would buy again.,5
7634,I would love it if it weren't so small! It's a great product and perfect for the base of your highlight!,4
7635,Doesn't show up as well as powder. Doesn't seem to stay too lomg. Pretty when first applied though. Very golden,3
7636,Arrived 3 days early. Great product. Smaller than I thought it would be but nevertheless satisfied.,5
7637,Arrived 3 days early. Great product. Smaller than I thought it would be but nevertheless satisfied.,5
7638,"really only for very fair skinned people. it looks nice, but also gets kind of cake-y",3
7639,LOVE IT ! Gives me the best highlight ever ! It's a little small but so worth it !,4
7640,This looks so natural. Love it. It also doesn't make my pores visible.,5
7641,"You definitely have to use this product lightly don't press too hard when you use it. Otherwise very nice, cute and a little pinkish tone!",4
7642,A beautiful glow stick! Provides a nice highlight that I use on my cheekbones and I do get compliments :),4
7643,"Beautiful, but doesn't stay put as well as I'd like. I keep it in my purse to reapply as needed.",4
7644,"wouldn't recommend, doesn't apply nicely on top of foundation",3
7645,"has a beautiful, natural shine for all skin tones.",5
7646,Beautiful highlighter... but it's not really waterproof. Will buy it again.,4
7647,It's not really waterproof but has a nice lasting power.,4
7648,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS HIGHLIGHTER. Gives me the dewy/wet look I desire! Must buy!,5
7649,"It is very nice, just expected a little darker. It would look great on tan or dark  a complected person.",4
7650,This is a wonderful highlighter . i recommend this to every women who wants a highlight to there face.,5
7651,It's okay doesn't blend well I actually use it as lip stick instead,2
7652,"It's not as bright as I had hoped, but it is nice.",3
7653,Great! and it makes an awesome base for eye shadow also!,5
7654,Really hard to apply. While applying it removes all other make up,1
7655,This is a great highlighter. I use it every day to contour my face!,5
7656,TERRIBLE waste of money! Literally does nothing and broke my face out!,1
7657,It's a pretty good product. I was expecting something a little different but over a a pretty darn good product,3
7658,Nice highlighter. It's cheap but it's good.,4
7659,Sponges are very soft. Perfect for blending. They do expand when wet just a bit. Cleaner works great too.,4
7660,Great product for a great price.  Easy to clean and good product,5
7661,They are ok. A little to firm so it makes using the different shapes a little difficult.,2
7662,Four stars because thought they'd be bigger .overall there okay . I still need to try them out . So I'll update in a few .,4
7663,Not worth a penny. Sponges broke off handles within days. Don't waste your money.,1
7664,Good price but not very good quaility. In this sense you kind of get what you pay for. Sponges are very stiff.,2
7665,Great price but terrible chemical smell and brushes will not apply my blush cream like I want,1
7666,One of the pieces wasn't entirely glues on and broke off when I was applying makeup to it. But everything else was fine,4
7667,Didn't even work right the charger didn't work.,1
7668,"Great, but I was expecting for a circular motion on the brush part not just a vibration mode",4
7669,Great deal and the little girls in my salon love getting them...,5
7670,Ok quality.  They did not hold up as well as others.  They got frizzy.,2
7671,These were not feathers at all. I should have checked the description better.  Very cheap quality indeed.,2
7672,These colored off on our hands and didn't last long in the hair.,1
7673,I usually don't like to be negative but these feathers look dope. They just Tangled so fast. And bush up so quickly,1
7674,They're so soft and long! I love the colors and can't wait to put more in.,5
7675,Very fake looking and feeling. I would not recommend.,2
7676,"Fast shipping, great prices, great product. Would buy again",5
7677,Waist of money for me and ripped my hair out! Luckily I have naturally wavy hair so i could cover up the almost bald spot!,1
7678,I thought I was ordering feathers but I got synthetic hair with the chevron pattern on it. I actually liked this better than real feathers.,4
7679,Exactly as they were described! So happy with what I received!,5
7680,"Haven't put them in my daughters hair yet, but the colors look good.",5
7681,I was expecting to receive feathers for my hair. Hair feathers. What I got in the mail was actual synthetic hair extensions dyed with a feather-like pattern,2
7682,girls loved them at town wide party!  Easy to apply.,5
7683,They will not stay in my daughter's hair. Disappointed,2
7684,Three-pack is a good investment....this stuff always makes my head feel better.,5
7685,"one of the best products i ever used, keeps your acne under control!",5
7686,Great if you go to YouTube for instructions but loses suction after 4 times.,2
7687,its cheap.  doesnt work like a real microdermabrasion machine.,2
7688,"Help on white spat , on my daughter. is good",5
7689,It does not suck it up as I expected.  Very difficult to assemble.,2
7690,I use only the blackhead suction.  The diamond heads didn't work well.,2
7691,I would like to now where can I order the vacuum treatment heads. Love the product. But can't use it!,4
7692,"It doesent really make a doference, its just a waste of your money",1
7693,"Great portable device for the money. Suction and power are mediocre, but great for weekly treatment.",4
7694,"Great results!  After the first treatment, the result were noticed.",5
7695,It works fairly well but the tips could be a better quality,4
7696,"The product is not bad,but the plastic head is not too strong",4
7697,"The microdermabrasion machine only worked once, the machine is not suctioning anymore.",1
7698,The directions are not as clear as they should be.,4
7699,I have this thing for a while and still waiting when it's gonna work.,3
7700,Great for acne...my daughters back acne started clearing up after just one treatment!!!,5
7701,Very disappointed.  Was not able to get them to grab a hold to facial hair.,1
7702,Decided to keep after I tried them.  They work great,5
7703,Love these for exfoliating and cleansing. Just wish I could still order them.,5
7704,Terrible! Garbage! I don't know why they even make this crap! I doesn't cleanse at all.,1
7705,"Not exactly what I expected, but they are adequate for scrubbing makeup off before bed.",4
7706,"I think I am allergic to them
Has to stop using",1
7707,really don't know yet as I have not received them yet.  I expect them to work the same as the Buf Pufs  work.,5
7708,Not remotely as good as the now discontinued Buf-Puf. Would never buy again.,1
7709,There was no foam and they weren't textured the Same as buff puff.,3
7710,Not like buff-puffs but will do...they don't lather up as much as the buff-puffs...,4
7711,"was so happy to find these, love them. My old source doesn't carry them any longer.",5
7712,They work reasonably well.  Price was definitely great.  Will buy again.,3
7713,Prefect for my daughter. She's 11 and takes it to school with her.,5
7714,"I use this brush for all my wigs.  Cute and colorful, serves its purpose!",5
7715,Worked well until the bristle backing came off the handle.,2
7716,Works great on adult hair as well as a pocket brush,5
7717,Great brush! So much better than what I had before!!!,4
7718,my granddaughter will now let her mother brush her hair. Does great with wet or dry hair. 5 Star,5
7719,got ALL caught in daughters hair even though is supposed to glide through and detangle,1
7720,Its more of a burgundy color but I liked it so it was fine.,3
7721,Came way early which was nice. But I wanted BLACK and got PURPLE,3
7722,This lipstick is not black. It is like a dark brick red. Very disappointed!,1
7723,"I don't care too much for the window , but the comfortability of the drake when fastening is perfect.",4
7724,The part where you close the Cape pinches the customer and if uncomfortable to use it is just attached to a pin vs using velcro,2
7725,My plastic in the cape was sew together. So it cannot be open or used for my job. I'm pretty unhappy.,1
7726,It was super late but it was exactly what I wanted,5
7727,"Don't bother! Mine arrived damaged so I just threw it away, waste of money",1
7728,I recieved it faster than expected!! Great cape!,5
7729,"Chuck slips, but it's an ok grinder for nails.",4
7730,Broke the same day it arrrived. Not worth the money.,1
7731,"Only for natural nail, its not good for extension nails :(",2
7732,Parts are very tiny and took long time to get here,1
7733,"It's work for 10 min. total, didn't worth 1 cent, not the time i wait for it",1
7734,"Strong motor love this, does the job.  Happy with my purchase.",5
7735,Did not like it does not work at all and they keep coming off.,1
7736,I bought this one for my wife and she has been really satisfied with the quality of this one. This is really an amazing purchase!,5
7737,The first try it got hot an burtn out very poor product,1
7738,"Really awful. Doesn't work with any batteries.  But it was so cheap, I think...not worth sending back.",1
7739,Only works 2-5 seconds before becoming so hot it cannot be handled. Piece of junk.,1
7740,"So far it seems to work okay,some pieces better than others.",4
7741,it not use. after change battery the battery holder loose,1
7742,"Good quantities for overnight trips. You might need other gels/liquids on your travels, depending on your daily makeup/beauty routine.",5
7743,"Ok, but very small and the packaging was not gift worthy. A little crushed when I received it.",2
7744,"The product itself was great, but the individual units were a little small. Great for creating gift packs, or family trips!",3
7745,All the other girls were so jealous of my pods! They made carry on a breeze. Will definitely order again.,5
7746,Amazing product! It is perfect for traveling and fits into small makeup bags for a quick overnight trip!  I ordered more I liked them so much.,5
7747,This is the perfect holiday gift for my co-worker who travels all the time!,5
7748,I paid $ 34 when I purchased it  but now  it is $ 24...I  liked this soothing gel though,3
7749,My baby's face cleared up in 2 days. Worked like magic. I'm going to order 2nd one to keep it as emergency stack.,5

7751,This product really works for baby acne. Great product! Will buy it again,5
7752,Really good on baby skin trouble!!!!: ),5
7753,Love it. It really smooth my baby skin well.,5
7754,These are super soft and cute! They are also very comfortable! I like how you can change out the clips with a headband!,5
7755,Very easy to clip in. Shipped and arrived on time.,4
7756,"Bought these for our daughter to be a wolf for halloween, perfect color and great quality! She still wears them even 2 months later!",5
7757,They keep leaning to the side and it's annoying one star,1
7758,These where horrible! They fell apart when I got them. When I attached them to the headband they just fell off. I'm disappointed.,1
7759,"My 11 year old daughter loves these ears, and gets compliments on them whenever she wears them!",5
7760,"Perfect!!! Also left review on tail
My teen daughter loved these and so many complemented how nice they were tysm",5
7761,i got this for my niece and she love it she was sooooo happy  and the quality was great,5
7762,"These are soft, adorable, and good quality! And after I figured out that the hair clips are reversable, they were extremely easy and secure!",4
7763,"Cute, clip on well
don't reconmend this if u have very short hair tho",5
7764,One of the best inexpensive moisturizers I have ever used.,5
7765,Ain't nothin better than some Cerave lotion at this price.,5
7766,Absolutely love this lotion and I'm very picky about lotions,5
7767,If you are familiar with Cerave you know this is a great brand of skin care.  What a great price on Amazon Pantry!,5
7768,Not oily at all and a little bit goes a far way.,5
7769,Have been using for a couple of years very good product,5
7770,"Great product. Better than my expensive spa product. This was recommended by a YouTube blogger, and I'm so grateful  I have dry, sensitive skin",5
7771,"Nice and light, yet very moisturizing. Doesn't make my acne-prone skin break out. Thumbs up.",5
7772,"Very pretty, but much longer than I am used to.,",5
7773,The ball had no hole in it so I can't even wear it,1
7774,It sucked it broke within an hour of putting it in.,1
7775,It arrived with the jewels already fallen off in the mail.,1
7776,I love it. It's so cute and so light weight.,5
7777,Item broke before I even got a chance to wear it. Spend a little more and get something not so cheap!,1
7778,It is absolutely beautiful!!  I really do love it! My favorite one I have ever bought.,5
7779,It fell apart the first day I wore it. Its kind of clunky and a bit larger than I like.,1
7780,Arrived a week after being ordered! Super cute too!!,5
7781,"Dissapointed:/ So pretty, but it broke after a week.",3
7782,"Item broke first day. Wrong ball sent for top, lucky I had an old one. Complete waste of money",1
7783,I love it and I get many compliments with this piece.,5
7784,Gave this as a gift and it broke the next day made really cheaply but the price was cheap so what do you expect,1
7785,I love this accessory! It is so stylish and complements well on me. This is worth buying!,5
7786,Very pretty but didn't last long until the bottom broke off,2
7787,Better than the picture it's just so beautiful!!,5
7788,only downside is its kind of heavy for a belly button ring,4
7789,Really nice looking but I can't really wear it because it irritates my belly button,1
7790,Its a lot cheaper made then i thought. The jewels fell out after only wearing it a couple of times.,1
7791,I do not like how it is all one piece. But other than that its super cute,4
7792,Broke the first week. My belly rings usually last me years.,1
7793,"It does look just like the picture, but after only a week it broke off and I tried reattaching it but it still fell apart.",3
7794,Love this ... I hope I don't run out anytime soon and when I do I will be getting more,5
7795,Works really well to boost the effects of numbing gel for microneedling procedures.,5
7796,"used to make local procedures (example, tattoo) less painful. MIght make your head spin a little",5
7797,Terrible product for a premium price. Didnt work for me at all. Had to purchase another anesthetic. And the seller refused to accept it back,2
7798,Great for numbing skin prior to using automatic micro-needling derma pen.,5
7799,"excellent. works fast, numbs well. I use this for permanent cosmetics and it works like a charm on broken and intact skin.",5
7800,Great product does all that we hoped it to do.,5
7801,This is great for hands & fingernails .... plus it isn't messy to carry in a handbag.  <3,5
7802,I like the feel and texture but I did not like the scent.,3
7803,It smells pleasant and provides a nice barrier on my skin.,5
7804,"I like this as a slightly cleaner way to keep my hands from drying out, plus it smells great.",5
7805,I love using the Bee Bars especially in the winter time.  This is the best solution for dry hands I have found!,5
7806,"Im so in love with these Bee Bars.  They smell great, last a very long time and leave my hands greaseless and soft.",5
7807,"Love Bee Bar, Vanilla.  Works great on rough heels. love the smell.",5

7952,They were ride Up the nostril..  And small and I don't have that big if a nose,1

7968,This pillow is good quality and the perfect gift for emoji lovers.,4

7978,"Took a LONG time to get here, but it's cute.",4
7979,Does the job for which it was designed.  Fits perfectly over the taps on our kegorator.,5
7980,They work great. Not much more to say :),5
7981,Hard to understand how to use better off doing a braid urself but great shipping,3
7982,"must  have octopus hands to use, directions not in English.",1
7983,The instructions were awful and I haven't figured out how to use this properly.,1
7984,"These don't hold your hair right.  Buy large old fashioned clips, they work better.",2
7985,I can see how this would work but my daughters hair is fine and thin so it doesn't work for her. ,3
7986,These are perfect for when you want your hair to end up in a mess of matted knots.,1
7987,"It can help a friend to do your hair for you, but it is not easy to use on your own hair",3
7988,I don't even know how to use it. Bought it thinking it came with instructions doesn't.,1
7989,These are much harder to use thend I expected.  They are in a drawer after trying several times to use them,1
7990,It's probably just me but I have no idea how to put these on. The paper instructions are no help.,2
7991,Have not yet figured out how to use these things but eventually they'll come in handy.,5
7992,"Wish it would've come with instructions, but YouTube works just fine",2
7993,"Wouldn't buy again, the end pieces are not easily concealed by hair . Shipping took close to a month.",1

7995,"hard to understand how to use, instructions hard to read",1
7996,Maybe its just me? I cant do it! My hair is so thick it doesnt fit,1
7997,I didn't like the product. I rather french braid my own hair,2
7998,As pictured. I'm still trying to figure out how to keep it from poking out of my hair at the top.,3
7999,"Unable to use on myself
Maybe it's a matter of Learning",2
8000,"its nice, i know how to braid, thought this would make the braid tighter but it feels odd, more than anything.",3
8001,"This only comes with two pieces. The directions weren't really that good. However, once you figure it out, it does work as stated.",3
8002,I am quite sure once I take the time and learn how to use it,3
8003,"Works well :) Nice scent, non greasy feel. Would definitely buy again.",4
8004,Used this on Saturday for white water rafting! I only applied it in the morning and my face was protected all day!,5
8005,The product works ok..the problem is when I tranfered the sunscreen into 3oz travel bottles the 2nd one was 1/3 full.. Not 6oz..maybe 4.5 at the most,1
8006,This lotion is a bit too watery for me. Don't like the smell either.,2
8007,"I haven't gotten a rash from this, I always break out with sunscreen. So, I'm excited",4
8008,i couldn't get this this thing to stay in my nose. it really needs a backing,3
8009,"These are great quality, they scrub well and seem durable.",5
8010,Nothing fancy. Does what it's made to do and seems to be durable so far.,5
8011,"The loofa would be great, but it is tiny!",1
8012,Gets the job done! I love that it doesn't fall apart!,5
8013,"Used long enough to report it's never unraveled like all the other ones and perfect size too.  Oh, nice colors too!",5
8014,"These stay tight. They are a bit small, but the still work very well.",5
8015,They were larger than I expected.  Garlic gets lost in it and doesn't work as well as I expected.,2
8016,"Poufs are a little smaller than I expected, but they do the job.",3
8017,"Time will tell how long these last, so will revisit review later, but like the colors and if they hold up, will definitely reorder!",4
8018,"I love these.  Cheap. Last a few months, and cheap enough to toss when they get old or unsanitary.",4
8019,"They scrub my body, are reasonably priced, and aren't pink.  I like them.",5
8020,They fall apart pretty fast. Probaly why they come in packs of three.,3
8021,Helps my tendonitis.  I can walk better with it on.,5
8022,Works great!  Had knee pain for over a year -- this puts the proper pressure on so I have no pain when I walk or exercise!,5
8023,"Haven't had to use it much, but it helps",5
8024,"Have used these for years,a very good knee brace.seller was great gotthem before expected date.",5
8025,I was expecting 2. Only received 1.. Now I have to wait longer.,1
8026,Best knee strap out there for patella problems I have several in all colors,5
8027,"DO NOT let the price fool you. It gave me some relief, it helped me so what.",4
8028,Absolutely Beautiful. A little difficult keeping it on my head.  Longer hair or an up do would have no Problem.,4
8029,Beautiful crown worth the money. Looks just like in the picture. Only one problem it came broken.,4
8030,Was broken but easily returned and replaced. Looks great.,5
8031,"Very good value. ""Blonde"" pins are actually a copper or rose gold color.",4
8032,"They work really well. They are just as good as what you can buy and other stores for a much, much better price.",5
8033,I wish they were a little stiffer but for the price they seem to work well in my daughters hair for ballet.,4
8034,Great price for a lot of hair spirals. Eat your heart out Goody.,5
8035,These work great to hold buns in place for those with extra long hair.,5
8036,The nob at the bottom gets stuck in my hair!,1
8037,Not as great as all the youtube hype but works.,3
8038,"Awful! They rip out my hair, do not glide at all, and are cheap. Do not waste a dime on these garbage pins.",1
8039,"Love these hair twist holders. Nice by bulk, if you like to remove hair pins randomly around home, school, car etc.",5
8040,"Excellent value, just wish the tips were rubberized like the ones sold in stores",4
8041,These are just so handy and don't damage my hair,5
8042,"Did not have smooth ends, so they're a little rough on my hair, but they hold a bun in place all day.",3
8043,The ends are sharp and cut  and pull my hair. ends need to be covered with something,2
8044,These work just as well as the brand name ones that I keep losing! Great buy.,4
8045,"Okay, for long hair these are the best invention ever!  What can I say they just WORK!",5
8046,I have really long hair. These hold my hair and stay in place. Most of all they are strong metal and didn't bend or break.,5
8047,"Great price, but the paint chips off the black ones easily and the lighter colored ones tarnish or something and change colors.",3
8048,Amazing price and no difference in quality from the more expensive hair pins.,5
8049,The color is very nice and i very love it. i hope to be using is more and more because the stain can last long.,5
8050,It is not like what I thought but it's good,4
8051,It works but i don't like the smell in it,3
8052,Not what I was expecting it's really sticky and you have to wait awhile till you can peel it off,3
8053,"Sticky and a little hard to use, but I really like the color it leaves.",4
8054,"Was like jello in a tube, lid popped off, and it made my lips bleed",1
8055,I liked the color but the product sucks. it wouldn't come out of the tube and the clear thing kept popping off.,1
8056,This lipstick stays on for a very long time but the color is hideous. It's more like a hot pink rather than a rose pink.,3
8057,Lasts forever works great gotta put it on quick it starts to dry pretty fast,5
8058,"Amazing, they all came way earlier that I thought and all in perfect shape!",5
8059,No i don't like it!! Its like to put glue in your lips!!!,1
8060,Although this product and kinda hard to apply you get used to it later on and the color is really eye popping I love it!,4
8061,"Nice! I really like it, but unfortunately, it is a bit messy when applying. But other than that, it is great!",4
8062,Took about 25 day to get here. I love the Cherry Red color!,5
8063,"I did not like the tint color, it was too light, the lipstick stain didn't lady as promised.",1
8064,Super messy and you have to be precise not to get it on your skin. Will stain your skin,3
8065,"Its not long lasting at all, once you drink or eat , it just disappear",1
8066,It wasn't a rich red like the advertisements show. Also would horribly stain my teeth.,1
8067,Love the color of this product! I just don't like how its hard to get on evenly.,5
8068,"The stain did not work for me, but it worked for my mother. I'm confused on the product.",2
8069,"The product color is more like a fuschia-strong pink, definitely not what my daughter was expecting.",3
8070,"Takes to long to work, then just looks like I ate something red.",2
8071,"Shipping took like a month and it does not work good, it doesnt stay that long, it taste nasty, you're better  off buying a lipstain",1
8072,easy to apply but it a pain when it gets on the cracks of the lip. and gets on teeth when I smile,4
8073,this is good for party favors for little girls and would be a hit...this brand peels off nicely,4
8074,Really messy.. But if you know how to work it then it's alright.,3
8075,"I like the product, but I do recommend using a lip brush rather than just the squeeze tube for a more precise and even application.",5
8076,Applying lipsticks wouldn't be a hassle anymore with this lip tattoo.,5
8077,"Seems like it would work really well, but it froze in shipping so it may have ruined the consistency",2
8078,I can eat a red tootsie pop and have the same effect.,1
8079,"It works really well! easy to apply if you just take your time, and lasts a long time. It also came earlier than expected.",5
8080,"very bad product
Tathurt my lips and blood came when  I remove.",1
8081,This stuff doesn't work like I had seen it in makeup reviews.,2
8082,I love the color super cute. Does make your lips dry though.,4
8083,i really liked this product although it looked darker than i expected,4
8084,"interesting! this color is a much darker pink than expected, but it is a pretty pink toned stain.",4

8370,Supper nice lots of hair but it look like it will get Tangled and it's really nice the quality of the hair looks real recommend the brand,4
8371,Smelled like beeswax and did not see much improvement for the price.  Look further.,1
8372,"I use on acrylics and it lifts, peels and chips. Not very durable",2
8373,The colors were exactly as scene on the pic. I really enjoyed these colors.,5
8374,Beautiful colors  Chips long before I'd expect it to.,3
8375,I got the wrong colors. I ended up getting two shades of red and no black which I needed.,3
8376,This is an awesome gel polish easy to use and colors are beautiful. Recommend making sure you have a light to use this product.,5
8377,Polish is nice it just tool a long time to get here,5
8378,works well.  hangs in the shower to 'dry' between showers.,5
8379,Wonderful product that allows me to scrub my back without anyone's help.,5
8380,"Great brush. Small in size, very soft, spreads foundation really nicely.",5
8381,"The smell is way too strong. Moisturizing, but I notice no difference regarding stretch marks.",2
8382,"Great product. Had my girlfriend using it but she is allergic to almost everything, had to stop using it.",4
8383,It doesn't work on me but it doesn't mean won't work on others because every body  is different,1
8384,Hi I believe is very good in my stretch marks and my kids is used too and is working perfect thanks for you service,5
8385,"The scent is kinda foul, maybe because I am pregnant but its not that pleasing. The product itself is thick and I like it!",3
8386,Did not work for me. Applied it as directed to the reddish colored stretchmarks around my shoulders.,1
8387,My daughter scar is fading away in couple of weeks it really works,5
8388,Although they did not go away completely I definitely did notice a difference. They seemed more smoothed out and faded.,3
8389,It's a wonderful product. My wife loved it.,5
8390,"I like this product ..this is my second order and I will continue order more .., good quality and reasonable prices thank you so much",5
8391,Smooth and fresh smelling. Need more time to test but so far so good.,4
8392,"Very moisturizing. It helps the appearance of stretch marks by moisturizing the dried pulled skin deeply, but probably does not remove long term",3
8393,My stretch marks were not as noticeable after two weeks and I received my product exactly when state..,5
8394,"Very, very nice. It has a heavenly smell. Very luxurious.",5
8395,"Smooth cream, after a few weeks of use seems to be reducing the appearance of post baby stretch marks!",4
8396,I couldn't get past the smell of this unfortunately.,2
8397,I only used it a few times but so far it goes on smooth and my skin feels soft.,4
8398,I use the cream 2x a day and I do notice my scar fading away,5
8399,It's too early to tell if it really helps with stretch marks but the product itself is nice.  A nice smooth cream with a light smell,4
8400,it seems to be working on my strech marks so far. hope it keeps working as i lose the weight.,4
8401,I love this product it gives my feet a smooth feel. It was fun and east to do.,5
8402,Great results. Try not to get it into your eyes though.,5
8403,Works great and my lashes are long and look wonderful.,5
8404,Does the job for me! My lashes were thinning out due to age :(  This product restored my lashes to original fullness...,5
8405,"Been using it for 6 months saw mild results on my eyebrows but nothing on my eyelashes, and felt some irritation in my eyes. Disappointed.",1
8406,No difference in lashes. Gave me a terrible rash on my eyelids.,1
8407,I had a reaction to it. Doesn't mean it doesn't work,1
8408,No noticible growth. Intense stinging. Not my favorite.,2
8409,"I had long eye lashes to begin with, but this product has seemed to make my lashes fuller.",5
8410,This doesn't seem to do anything to my lashes. I wouldn't recommend it.,1
8411,"This solution burned my eyes. I am used to using Latisse, so just keep your eyes closed until it dries!",2
8412,"Product did not work at it says, no change what so ever.",1
8413,"I used this nightly but have never seen any improvement in my lashes. I was very disappointed, especially for the cost.",1
8414,Not as good as some of the other brands that are more expensive. Other people may have better luck.,3
8415,"I've been applying for the past 14 days, and still don't see any real difference as of yet. I will continue to apply",1
8416,Stings if it gets in your eye! Takes a long time to notice the growth and fullness.,2
8417,I will continue to purchase this awakening product. Creators= innovative and inspiring.,5
8418,This product doesn't work! And it burns horribly. Why create a product you apply to your eyelashes that burns your eyes?,1
8419,"I applied it for over a month, and had no luck with it. My lashes didn't get thicker nor longer.",1
8420,This did not work for me. I prefer rapid lash.,1
8421,This is snake oil and does nothing to help your lashes grow.,1
8422,"Works ok, not as good as Smartlash which I have used in the past!!",4
8423,After 4 weeks of applying I still have not had any results. I'd spend your money on a higher end product and gain results faster.,2
8424,I've been using for about 3 weeks and I see a slight difference.,4
8425,It seems impossible to keep out of my eye and it burns. I haven't been able to use it enough to tell a difference.,1
8426,The previous eyelash serum I used provided a fuller look.,3
8427,"Been using for almost 2 months, I don't see much growth. I won't buy this again.",1
8428,I have been using the product for two weeks now and I love the difference in my lashes!!!  Finally no false eyelashes!,5
8429,Like the compact size and same amount of product as others that are similar. Too soon to judge efficacy.,4
8430,No difference after 4 months and it stings my eyes if any drips into them.,2
8431,Didn't work and made my eyes burn when it dripped down. Not worth the risk to my eyes.,1
8432,I am loving this! My lashes are getting longer!!,5
8433,I have been using daily for 5 weeks now and do not notice a difference in my eyelashes at all.,3
8434,does not work at alll.... such a waste of money,1
8435,I used it for about 6 weeks and saw absolutely no change in my lashes.,4
8436,Easy to apply and I feel like I see positive results after only a few uses.,5
8437,"unfortunately, i see zero growth.  Rapidlash is a much better product.",1
8438,"WOW, I AM BEGINING TO HAVE EYELASHES.  WHAT A  DIFFERENCE.",5
8439,"I'm sure it will take a while to show some results, will update if longer lashes are noticed",3
8440,I've tried latisse and pravage. This works better at a fraction of the cost. Buy it!,5
8441,Haven't seen a big difference unfortunately. I waited to post until a month or more passed to see any results and Im not seeing much.,3
8442,Haven't seen any change in length or volume in 3 weeks.,2
8443,I have been using the product for 8 weeks without results,1
8444,"I have used it everyday but I did not see any improvement with my eyelashes.
It causes some irritations with my eyes..
It was not worth it.",2
8445,"Unfortunately, this product didn't work for me. I honestly had hoped it would but I never noticed a difference.",2
8446,Used as instructed for 3 months. Absolutely nothing happened. Easy to apply. Burns a little when freshly applied but not bad.,2
8447,Not thrilled. Too small for price. Rapid Lash much better,1
8448,It is so thin that it is difficult not to get it in your eye.  Used it for a month and no noticeable difference in the length.,2
8449,I'm at 7 weeks and my lashes MIGHT be a little fuller but aren't longer.,3
8450,"I bought the product for a friend of mine, and she has voiced no complaints to me.",5
8451,I have used the serum for over three weeks with no results,1
8452,I've been using this twice a day for almost two months and there is no difference,1
8453,Unfortunately I've never had much in the area of eyelashes.  I believe they are getting slightly thicker.,5
8454,I'm okay with the eyelash growth serum but not impress,3
8455,Seems to be working some... but I am terrible at remembering to apply as needed...,4
8456,I have HORRIBLE lashes and I'm sorry to say I really don't think this helped.,3
8457,I haven't noticed any difference and I apply it as directed.,3
8458,It's great. I've tried more exp products and the works fantastically. Love it,5
8459,Have only been using for a few day's so do not really know if it is going to work.,5
8460,"A very nice product, but I haven't used it long enough to see any measurable increase in my lashes!  Still hoping!",5
8461,"I SEE THICKER LASHES AND WHERE I HAD A ""BALD"" SPOT FROM USING LASH EXTENSIONS - I NOW HAVE LASHES",5
8462,Took about 4 weeks but it really does work.  My lashes are noticeably fuller and longer.,5
8463,I had to stop using it since every time it would sting my eye  :-(,2
8464,Did not do anything. NOT EFFECTIVE AT ALL!!! So Guys don't even bother  it's a waste of your money.,1
8465,I used it a few weeks every night and saw no changes.,1
8466,I keep going back and forth about whether or not this is working but I like to think it is,3
8467,Unfortunately I had to return it after 3 nights of use. This product was burning my eyes and causing me bad head ache in the morning.,1
8468,I was skeptical but after one bottle there was noticeable difference . I would recommend using this  with other products to enhance the effect.,3
8469,"Yes it works!!!! in Two weeks I have fuller, longer lashes!!",5
8470,"Love this item, it last a long time. I noticed a difference in about 2-3 weeks. Have to give it a chance",5
8471,Didn't do the trick. I thought it made my formerly Latisse lashes less visible. :( Wouldn't recommend.,3
8472,Didn't work at all. Don't waste your money on this product,1
8473,Absolutely Awful!!! It irritated my eyes so bad they have not stopped watering 52 hours later.... This is so horrible!!,1
8474,I'm still waiting for the results. Have not noticed any changes yet.,3
8475,Been using product and haven't noticed a difference yet.,3
8476,"I Have used this product daily for two weeks now.
I have noticed very little change in my eyelash growth.",2
8477,This product doesn't seem to work as well as others I have tried.  Will not order again.,1
8478,"I've been using the product for a few weeks, but haven't noticed a difference in my lashes yet.",3
8479,I have 1 month using this and i have not seen any result,1
8480,"I see improvement in my lashes, but not much. It took a while to notice difference.",3
8481,Ships really fast and you have to use it for a long time to make it work,5
8482,"I've using this product for a week, and I already can tell my eyelashes are getting bigger!",5
8483,"not sure yet, it's been 3 weeks and I see no difference",3
8484,I can see it working.  It's not a miracle product but it works.,4
8485,Used this for 6 weeks but didn't see any change in eyebrow growth.,3
8486,Pretty good results it stings my eye at times but will get back with you about the eyelashe growth,4
8487,It's been two weeks and I haven't seen any results yet. Will keep trying.,3
8488,WORKS QUICKLY. BETTER THAN MOST SERUMS. COULD TELL GROWTH IN FIRST WEEK.,5
8489,I am using it during the day but still haven't noticed any lash growth.  I'll wait to see results.,3
8490,I haven't noticed any change yet in my eye lashes. It's only been about 2 weeks.  If results change I will update my review.,3
8491,"Don't see a great change yet, but my lashes are slowly growing",4
8492,"No results! I have had this product for ove 3 weeks and the only thing that has happened is that my eyelashes are falling!
total disappointment!",1
8493,My lashes are thicker after 2 weeks of using it constantly every night....,5
8494,"I was pleased with your serum and service! Very prompt, Thank you",5
8495,I feel like my lashes has grown after 2 weeks of use. Also it seem healthier for my extremely curly lashes.,4
8496,I have not had any change in my lashes and if you are not careful putting it on and it gets in your eyes it burns really bad.,2
8497,Very easy to apply with no irritation.  Time will tell if it truly works.,5
8498,So far I've only been using the product for a few days and I can already tell a difference. Definitely recommend!,5
8499,Received the item fast and started using right away. I believe it takes time to see dramatic changes but can't wait to see them.,5
8500,Just started using it but I'm sure it will work great. I'll leave an updated review in a week or so.,5
8501,"This stuff really, really works!! Lashes started growing within 10 days.  Thrilled with the results.",5
8502,This product is amazing!  My eye lashes are darker and longer after only a couple of weeks.  I absolutely recommend it,5
8503,It burns just a bit after applying and then I feel nothing. My lashes seem to be growing back in and are visible again.,4
8504,Have already noticed a difference in my eyebrows and lashes.,5
8505,I have not seen any changes at. Will update if that changes.,2
8506,I was really excited to start this product after reading the reviews but I must say I'm quite disappointed I have not noticed any difference in my eyelashes,1
8507,Been using this religiously. Nothing happened. Waste of my time and money.,1
8508,I felt like my mascara would not stay on very well.,4
8509,I did not see any difference in the two weeks I used it except that it made my eyes itch.,2
8510,Doesn't work .I've been using it for over two week's and no difference in my eyelashes. Disappointed: (,1
8511,So far so good. This application  is not messy at all. Its a smooth process. I'll  update this  review  after a month of use,4
8512,This is a very good product been using it for over 2 weeks and I have definitely noticed a growth in my eyelashes,5
8513,"This product works, although I would caution users that if you blink too soon after applying it stings your eyes.",4
8514,So far I've been using it for a week! I'll update my review if something goes wrong.,5
8515,Awful - Really stings my eyes! I threw it out.,1
8516,"This product doesn't work. I used for a month did not see any improvement, also it made my eyes burn.",1
8517,I love it! It actually helped my eyelashes to grow! I would order again when it is out.,5
8518,It's easy too apply.  Waiting for my lashes to grow,5
8519,I have been using it with results yet. This is all i can give for s review right now.,2

8523,Have not seen any difference yet when I ask my daughter what she think s she said not yet,1
8524,I have only been using it for 15 days so I have not seen any difference.  From the reviews it seems to take about a month.,3
8525,"My wife is loving the gift. She was skeptical at first, but now thinks she will be ordering again when it is time.",5
8526,"I really have used it only a few weeks, but I think that I can tell growth.  It is too early to make an educated review.",4

8546,I used this product for a month and saw no results. I'm sending it back for a refund today.,1
8547,"Great product, can already tell a difference in my lashes after only a few weeks of application!",5

8550,This works so well!!!! I love the results I'm getting!,5
8551,"This is a scam, as soon as you purchase you will be solicited!!! Don't do it!!",1
8552,I have not seen any difference since i started using the product.,2
8553,This burned my eyes and in the two days I used it lashes were falling out.,1
8554,"Expensive and comes in a very teenie weenie container. So far, my eye lashes have not grown any extra length.",3

8558,I have been using for a few weeks.  I can see a difference.  They are thicker and longer.  I will buy again!,5
8559,"Unfortunately, this product stung my eyes the first time I tried to use it, so I had to return it.",1
8560,Sadly this growth serum did the reverse. It burned my eyes and caused eyelash loss. Glad it works for some people but not me.,1
8561,Do not know yet id it will work. Some mold lid irritation that dissapates.,3
8562,I have been using for a couple of weeks now and do not see much difference.  Will keep trying.,2
8563,I use it at night only and it seems to be working great.,5
8564,Does not work! I've been using it for almost a month and no difference in lashes.,1
8565,"I'm very happy with the results of this growth serum. My lashes are longer, fuller, and is easy to use",4
8566,I like the quality but too early to tell if it works or not. Good customer service and fast delivery,4
8567,I use the serum every other day and I have noticed an improvement in the length of my eyelashes.,4
8568,Eyelashes fell out and it burned my eyes so I returned it.,1
8569,Havr been using it for a week now. And i can see alittle bit of lenght changing..,5
8570,I really like this looking forward to seeing results...product received at reduced rate,4
8571,Haven't seen any progress as of yet and have been using for week. Will review again when i see a difference.,3
8572,They're so very thin. I'm so sad. I had no idea.,1
8573,"No where near as light as in the picture, with copper and black strands throughout the hair. Much thinner than expected.",1
8574,Not even close to real hair or double weft. So thin and straw like feeling. Returning asap. Very upset,1
8575,"Great quality! Very soft and very real looking and matches perfectly, BUT they are very thin and I recommend ordering 2 or 3 packs.",4
8576,Excellent color match.  Great quality.  However I would advise buying 2 packages instead of one. One make the hair look stringy and will need trimming.,4
8577,"I always buy my extensions from Sally's, these are so thin and skinny to look real. The truth is you get what you pay for.",3
8578,Super thin and inconsistent broken hair folicals and split ends. Really disappointed in the amount of shedding as well,1
8579,Extremely thick at the clips & straggly at the ends. NOT worth the price,1
8580,These are NOt 13 inches! Try 11 and really thin at the ends.,1
8581,"Great product, was as described. Will recommend to my family and friends!",5
8582,I would put 0 but it makes me put a star. Went to curl the hair and it BURNT!!! Not good.,1
8583,Absolutely horrible. This stringy tons of breakage...also missing small piece and clips coming off off hair. Also 2 to 3 inches shorter than advertised,1
8584,This is more like 60grm not a 105g not happy at all. Waste of my money.,1
8585,Don't buy these unless you have very thin hair. 110g is not enough for a full head of medium/thick hair.,1
8586,"Product is fine, I just don't know how to use it and make it look real",2
8587,"Not worth the money! Each extension does not have enough hair, so your natural hair is pretty visible with just some long strings of hair falling.",1
8588,Worst quality ever. Wish I could get my money back. After less than a week of wear they look like a synthetic Halloween witch wig.,1
8589,Not bad but not as nice as the ones I've got from Sally's beauty . They feel better after you do a deep contioner on them .,4
8590,My granddaughter loves this.  Due to medication she's losing her hair and these extensions are wonderful.,5
8591,Amazing price for these excellent quality clip on extensions. They are beautiful and well done,5
8592,Excellent quality and easy to use. Will buy again.,4
8593,"Horrible DONT BUY THESE, their super thin, and shed a lot",1
8594,It looked great and natural in my daughter's hair for the pageant. The price was fantastic as well.,5
8595,"The color was true to mine, very way to manage and apply to my own hair. I was able to sleep in them without and issue",5
8596,"Great quality hair! I bought the 10"" and they were perfect!! My hair is about half this long normally..looks great!",5
8597,Love love love I was very happy with this selection the hair color matched very soft hair I was able to style it with no issue thank you !,5
8598,Good extensions for the price. They were pretty think a d feel like horse hair tho ...,4
8599,One of my best purchases. Matches my hair almost perfectly.  I like them because they are thin...more natural look.,5
8600,These are ok to add volume but to thin at the bottom. I had to cut off about 2 inches,3
8601,I am very pleased with these extensions. Very good quality for the price and the color was well represented. I also find the clips hold well.,5
8602,I do hair and These extensions are horrible. Don't waste your time. Spend a little more and get better ones.,1
8603,"Perfect length actually a little longer than expected, and hair is perfect weight for my medium thick hair.",5
8604,"This hair is very thin, I would buy other extensions. I was very ddisappointed",1
8605,"They are the right color, bkends n my hair perfectly. However, they are very thin and i have thick hair.",3
8606,Very good quality. I would suggest two sets if you have particularly thick hair.,5
8607,So incredibly thin...absolute waste of your money.  Buy something else.,2
8608,Perfect color. Perfect length. Has been wondeful!!! Couldn't ask for a better product.,5
8609,Good length and color. Great item for the pricing.,4
8610,I love them. They blend with my hair well. I don't need to use all of them for my desired thickness.,5
8611,Some of the hooks were falling off but it was an easy fix,4
8612,"Adhesive was entirely satisfactory. Unlike the Dore brand, it had a brush attached to the lid. It was also considerably cheaper.",4
8613,This stuff is great.  Be careful not to glue your fingers together though.,5
8614,So far works great.  Pleasantly surprised by the strength and durability.  And so far no apparent allergic reaction.  Happy with this purchase.,5
8615,Works well and definitely kept my mask in place all day! Two thumbs up!,5
8616,Very good glue. We applied a gnarly leg wound with this and it made a NICE seamless look.,5
8617,"As someone who sweats off Spirit Gum, this stuff is the BEST OF THE BEST. Holds on prosthetics like a dream!",5
8618,this stuff is perfect for jewel clusters. i use it for my face painting,5
8619,Will hold just about anything you can think of only thing is my skin had a bad reaction to it.,4
8620,"Difficult to get the hang of application, but easy to use",4
8621,Great for Cosplay Urethane masks like Tigerstone FX's Robin masks.,5
8622,Did not work...used as directed and still didn't work!,1
8623,Great for lightweight items like stockings but not strong enough for long term (think 2-3 days) hold.,3
8624,Holds breast forms in place all day long... maybe longer.,5
8625,A must have for FX makeup - preferable to spirit gum.,5
8626,Worked great. A little baby oil easily removed this from my skin,5
8627,"Arrived as a bottle of solid, dry, white rubber.  Unusable.",1
8628,"It worked well, you definitely need the remover, hard to get off skin with out it",4
8629,I thought these were universal but they did not work on any of my doterra bottles or other bottles I had.... very disappointed,1
8630,"just as described - soft material, and very bendable. It's good",5
8631,"Really cute, and fun to wear on any random day. And it ships quickly",5
8632,i really loved the feel to it and really fast shipping,5
8633,Great item! Fast shipping! My daughter loved it!,5
8634,Cute Cute..i really like it.it has a safty pin and small ribbon to secure it.works nicely.and I like that you can bend it to how you want it.,5
8635,Love this tail. It's perfect. So easy to bend and shape to your own liking.,5
8636,Attaching the tail is slightly flimsy but am very happy with my purchase any way!,5
8637,Item is much better than expected. It's fully wired and holds it's shape well. It's soft and the fur quality is quite decent.,5
8638,"Nice to fill for gifts.  Small, yet ample for lip balm.",5
8639,These are great pump bottles for foaming soap or body wash. I haven't had any trouble with them tipping over.,5
8640,Within 2 weeks all the pumps on the four we ordered stuck and would not operate.,1
8641,So far so good. The bottles work just fine with no clogs or problems.,5
8642,These are nice foaming soap bottles. I got them to make soap and give as gifts. The price is very reasonable.,5
8643,I need more.  Keep ordering and keep giving them to friends with soap and their favorite essential oils.,5
8644,Hole clogs a bit with liquid soap (Dr Bronners),4
8645,I purchased these for homemade foaming handsoap. Pumps well.,5
8646,The colors are very pretty and vibrant. The reason for only one star is because it starts chipping after 2-3 days.,1
8647,"not bad, but seems extremely small.  hardly fits over my lady parts! too lazy to return so i'll regift it.",3
8648,"Good material, cleans easily. A bit heavy and bulky. If you're typically a size medium, I'd order a small.",4
8649,"Cute but we returned it.  It's too short, definately for a petite woman.",3
8650,They're super cute but changed colors within a week.,3
8651,Came fast and it was perfect quality for my braids! Will definetly buy again!,5
8652,Great. Cant reuse them because after a while they start to fade. Love them for the price.,5
8653,Too small in length as well as diameter.  Useless.,1
8654,"Love these. They last a lot longer than cheaper ones I've bought. Just love,love, love them. Kathy",5
8655,Great loofah. Highly recommended. I got them on sale for a great price.,5
8656,"Not a bad product, just difficult for me to use.",4
8657,more durable than expected.  Love the versatility. Effective full body scrub.,5
8658,"Soft scrubber. Ok, but odd. Get back. Hard to reach area.",3
8659,not as good as other I had bought in store. unravels.,1
8660,My family is stocked on back scrubbers! Great deal!,5
8661,Thanks very much! I really like these bath loofahs.,5
8662,"Good, just not as long as those they replaced and not as tightly braided",4
8663,not the heavy loofahs I ordered the first time that I ordered.,2
8664,Too stretchy to get any meaningful scrubbing going on. I have to fold it in half to get it to work the way I want.,3
8665,It's been 1 years since I use this cream I don't see any results yet and it burn a lot smh ,1
8666,Cant believe it but it really works!!!!,5
8667,"ordered for my daughter. Sizes are asian based, read here ""runs really small"". Pretty",4
8668,I am small so I expected it to be big but it is the nature of a Kimono BUT I love it regardless of it's size,5
8669,This looks like a total nighty. Something a grandma would wear to bed. Looks way cuter in the picture!,1
8670,Soo cute & the fit was perfect. I even bought it in another color :),5
8671,I get compliments everywhere I go when I wear this.,5
8672,"This was a great buy, I get compliments every time I wear it! So pretty !",5
8673,"Not quality fabric, but fine considering the price of the item",4
8674,"Beautiful Kimono looks exactly like the picture. I am 5'4"" and 100 pounds.",5
8675,"It was a little more brown than pink in the picture, but I love it! Very nice look that can be used for multiple occasions.",5
8676,Love it- fits well!!! Lots of compliments when I wear it.,5
8677,The colors are beautiful and it's lightweight and flowy. I ordered it from a different shop after this one and this shop definitely delivered more quickly.,5
8678,Love it! It a nice small unit perfect for home use. Love the colors too!,5
8679,This is the perfect size and just what I was looking for! It heats up the wax very well and has a nice lid for storage.,5
8680,Works great! I have an older version as well and was so excited to find this one on Amazon. Reliable product with accurate heat settings.,5
8681,"I'm in love with this hair product.  My  hair is growing fast, is shinny  . . . love it.",5
8682,My head broke out and my hair had no improvement.,1
8683,I question that these were new bottles.  No box for them and appeared to be used,1
8684,Love this product but it froze in my mail box Im hopeful the spray does not bust.,3
8685,Colors were soooo ugly i have thick hair and already ripped one of the scrunchiess.. 10 dollars for 5 generic rubber bands and faux fur .. hell nooo,1
8686,The fuzz it wrapped around the elastic as suppose to being fed through it. When u stretch it out the elastic is exposed.,1
8687,These didn't come in the cute colors shown... I got bright red ones and lime green. Ugly colors. False advertising.,1
8688,My  foot doctor recommended it and it really works on dry. cracked skin!,5
8689,Excellent med for crusty feet.  Takes due diligence every day.but in 2 - 4 weeks depending on condition of your crusty feet they will be amazingly soft,5
8690,This is a great in expensive eyebrow brush! It is not as hard as I wish it was but it does work well and does not shed.,4
8691,Great floss for people who have closely spaced teeth. Slides in between easily and does a good job.,5
8692,Prefer tape over floss and I have found the Oral B brand the best.,5
8693,I was happy to be able to orde dental TAPE.  iT'S HARD TO FIND.  My teeth cut FLOSS IN HALF.,5
8694,"Can't live without this soap. Great scent for all year, not just to use around the holiday's.",5
8695,"This soap is really nice. It has a lovely scent, it lathers up but does not get soft. Lasts a long time.",5
8696,Fantastic smell and my wife loves it.  Anything else matter?,5
8697,"Very natural and long lasting, Sure it aint cheap but it smells great and won't dry you out. Plus it will last a few months !",5
8698,wish this smelled a little more pepperminty it is a bit weak though lathers beautifully like all their soaps,4
8699,I was looking for a soap with a Christmas tree smell and this is it! Smells so good! Gorgeous packaging. Would make a nice gift.,5

8719,They fixed the formula since I used this years ago and it doesn't smell and works wonderfully!,5
8720,Didn't work for me. Ended up with spots. Will remain pale.,2
8721,"Really works for adding a ""glow"". Just remember to wash your hands after applying it!",5

8724,Received in a timely manner. Well packaged. Scent too strong. Doesn't really smell like eucalyptus.,3
8725,"Sort of eucalyptus oil smell, but not very nice.  It works for our purposes, but we'll be looking for a better/nicer product.",1
8726,Arrived with the dropper broken and the aroma smells awful and nothing like eucalyptus,1
8727,Great product. Very potent and the label is easy to understand. The only down side was my dropper was broken when I opened the box.,4
8728,"Eucalyptus can't say enough about it, just absolutely great!",5
8729,This smells like no other eucalyptus oil I've ever tried. It's actually nauseating if you know what it's supposed to smell like,1
8730,Lots of high quality oil. Exactly what I ordered....,5
8731,"Smell is very overpowering and smells nothing like eucalyptus oils I have had in the past. Bought it to use in the sauna, would NOT recommend.",1
8732,"Great gluten free cookies, however they are quite pricey for the amount in each package.",4
8733,Very good flavor and great taste.  I'm personally not a crispy cookie guy.,5
8734,Tate may not arrived unbroken but the are the best gluten free cookies. Simply melt in my mouth scrumptious.  Positively addictive.,5
8735,"These are very tasty cookies and they were well packaged, but somehow they still ended up as pieces of cookies.",3
8736,Great! it came earlier than expected and it looks just like the pictures,5
8737,Looks super cute but irritated and infected my bellybutton so i can't even wear it.,3
8738,"Cute, but It broke within a week of wearing, I'm very disappointed. I wouldn't waste your money like I did.",1
8739,This was a bit of an over sized belly right. After 2-3days it broke in half. I was very disappointed.,3
8740,Stones are a little big to gaudy. Wish it was a little more dainty.,3
8741,Do not put this in your body. Do not buy this.,1
8742,Broke after a few days. Husband fixed and it fell back apart days later. Bad quality,1
8743,"Cute and comfortable, I wear it daily and haven't had it break or tarnish.",5
8744,"I love the belly ring itself. It is pretty and looked great! However, the dangle fell off after only a week of wearing it.",2
8745,It was my favorite one but it broke easily :/,3
8746,So pretty! But breaks so easily...buying another one because it's so cute...hopefully this one lasts longer!,3
8747,"obsessed, use this mix with sikakai oil & hot water, my hair feels so thick and shiny!!!",5

8752,This product made my hair so soft and easy to comb after one use.,5
8753,Really handy.  Compact for travel. Bought 2 of them,5
8754,"Great case, easily fits 10, 15mil bottles plus extras space if you want to add more.",5
8755,3 stars because this came in as black not eggplant.,3
8756,"It does what it's supposed to do. Not fancy, color black. Nothing special",3
8757,It's nice but not as padded as I thought it was going to be,3
8758,"This is a great product, very useful, good size and not too bulky. Seems very well made and keeps my oils safe for travel.",5
8759,Liked it so much I bought another one!!!,5
8760,Great for 5ml essential bottles.  I carry it every day.,4
8761,"Great product, fits my 15ml oil bottles perfectly. Fast shipping.",5

8763,It seems 2 clog every other color change...regret I spent money on pro set,2
8764,Great product.  I used it daily with my airbrush system.  It effectively cleans up the makeup residue and helps to keep my stylus from clogging.,5
8765,This product is awsome it maintains airbrush clean. Try it!,5
8766,Doesn't clean very well.  Left residue. Do not recommend.,2
8767,Seems to work very well cleaning my airbrush after each use.,5
8768,If you are just starting dreads make sure you have 6-12 inches of growth. If you do not don't waste your money.,2
8769,came on time and had no problems with the product.,5
8770,"Worked great at first now doesn't work at all .
.",1
8771,It is the Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 that gives the great results but can be found in much less expensive products.,3
8772,"It works great under the eyes , use twice a week,",4
8773,"I had gotten one once before at a skincare store. Loved it. This one, did not work nearly as well.",2
8774,"Extremely disappointed, this is not the product I have used in the past. Will never buy from this company again.",1
8775,You get what you pay for and is as advertised. No complaints.,5
8776,I would like to return.  Too difficult to use.  Thought it was would much more simple.,1
8777,"Love this formula, really easy to use with great progress from  session to session. Will keep this post updated.",5
8778,Didn't like it and it didn't work for me at all. Big disappointment!,1
8779,Didn't see any results plus it's a bit messy .you have to be very patient. No I don't like the product not for me,2
8780,"The wrap is not so useful, it is too thin and it doesn't fast.",3
8781,I have noticed my skin softer more even. I'm excited to see the results.,5
8782,This is amazing! I wish I had taken before and after pics. It's an amazing product I will definitely buy it again,5
8783,"This item works great, i love using it to shave my head in between a #1 & #2, this is a #1.5",5
8784,"This was not what I thought it was.  I wanted a guide that was 1 1/2"" high.  This was considerably short in height.",2
8785,Do yourself a favor and spend the little extra for this one.  There are no sharp plastic burrs to scratch your head on these!,5
8786,"This is top of the line, all the 1 1/2s that I had purchased never fit well, this one fits like a glove!",5
8787,"its way better then that white guard, and the word Premium Guard is an understatement",4
8788,This is a very sturdy replacement for the flimsy 4.5 mm that Wahl gives us with the Five Star Senior. Good quality guard.,5
8789,This guard is perfect because you don't have to worry about it slipping off,5
8790,Love the guard definitely need to invest in more of the premium guards,5
8791,I  like my lookatool case for my Samsung galaxy s4.,4
8792,I got this for my niece for christmas. She loves it and it fit her phone perfectly. Very stylish and easy to use.,5
8793,Great product. About time Wahl made the quality of their guards a priority.,5
8794,Does what it's supposed to do!  Fits a Wahl trimmer and fits it well.,5
8795,With the first use of this guard one of the teeth broke off.,1
8796,"They have these masks in all the shops in Japan. The cost would be considerably less than a ruined blouse, sweater or dress.",4
8797,"Great gloss and very moisturizing. Not very tinted, but I will still continue to purchase.",5
8798,"Feels great, not sticky, cinnamon zing feeling, super moisturizing and smoothing.",5
8799,I have been a long time fan of this product and like having the ability to order from Amazon..,5
8800,This is perfect.  I don't see a lot of tint but that's fine - it works beautifully.,5
8801,I like the trial pack because it gives many options for different parts of the face.,4
8802,"Stupid, waste of money. Do physical exercises instead, its free and will yield in better results.",1
8803,good way to keep yourself practicing the smiling. will use it and see .,4
8804,"Wonderful packaging, item as described. Shipping was twice as fast as estimated. Thank you",5
8805,"only problem is the 1 month delivery, but I adjust my order time--the price is great, and the clinical studies speak for themselves",5
8806,Great. Fits Tight . Hurts A Lil When First Put On . But In All Its Great,4

8809,Bought these for my 14 year old daughter. She says they hurt really bad when she wears them.,1
8810,"Cute but hurts anywhere you put them, cartilage or not.",3
8811,"It is too tight, getting pain when i am wearing it",1
8812,I didn't expect much from them but they look real and they came to my house faster then I expected,5
8813,Got for my niece she is 9..how fun they are neat,5
8814,Theyre skinnyer than I thought and the black. Two of the pinks I got were broken. But they were still pretty good,3
8815,"I had three break in the first day, I'm not really sure how, just cheap I guess...they almost look real but look fake also",4
8816,Sometimes gets stuck in the open position. But overall good!,4
8817,Super cute and fits just right on my lower lip.recommended.,5
8818,Thought I would give these a try instead of a real piercing but they hurt to bad to wear,1
8819,These are WAY too big to be a nose piercing. They're bulky and stick out too much. Would not buy again.,1
8820,Really disapointed they are different from pictures and they ar in wierd sizes,1
8821,Use them all the time.  Afraid to really get my nose pierced,5
8822,its to big for nose and does not looks good !!!,1
8823,I really like this product and was exactly what I ordered.  Thank you!,5
8824,The only problem with this product is that it leaves sores on your nose and it hurts to pull it off,1
8825,It made a hole in my nose! I went to the docter to get it checked out tho.,1
8826,They are perfect. You can not at all thst my nose is not pierced.,5
8827,"Love love love these, however they are all a bit too big for me to use. But, great quality.",3
8828,There were 2 with the same color buy other wise an awesome product,4
8829,Did not come broken or damaged various sizes and your lip maybe sore for a day but it is way worth it,5
8830,"These came very fast and were exactly as described.  They were appropriately packaged, undamaged, and great.  My daughter loves them!",5
8831,"Fit well as a lip ring, looked a bit big for a nose piercing though",5
8832,"Shipping took forever and a day, lots of duplicate colors, and on top of it all they are too big for my nose.",2
8833,Not super sturdy but work awesome if you're gentle.,4
8834,They're WAY TO BIG  was expecting that and very upset about bit .,1
8835,Love it! Little hurt but that's totally ok tho :),5
8836,"came earlier than it said, but it's still a good buy if you're thinking about getting a piercing with a hoop",4
8837,Daughter not using and it's not that cute once it is on. Waste of money!,2
8838,"Looks completely fake.  Good if you're going for that vibe, I guess.",2
8839,It'd be nice if it came in more neutral colors.,2
8840,"They are not bad, one end pinches a little but I expected that. Overall I like them, they look like I have a real piercing.",3
8841,8 different colors and they're metallic. Im very pleased,5
8842,"They are larger than I anticipated, but still cute.",4
8843,I don't like them @ all they was too little,1
8844,Got one colored one the rest gold. Shopping took forever. Not worth it.,1
8845,I bought this as per my daughter's request for her bohemian-themed slumber party. They look so fake but at the same time funny.,4
8846,cute fun better then actually piercing yourself no one would know the difference!,3
8847,"Better than I actually expected, get them. :)",5
8848,"Great I love them , ppl really believe my nose is pierced and very fashionable.",5
8849,"Works as well as name brand gel polish. Shipping was slow, but it was worth it.",5
8850,It was too watery for my liking and it was choppy never applied good on the nails,1
8851,"These are some bomb nail polishes. I love the colors, they're very pigmented. They go on smooth and stays on long.",5
8852,Disappointed!!! This gel nail polish only lasted me two days.,1
8853,The colors when on do not match the colors in the images to the point where I thought I received the wrong product. Wouldn't order again.,2
8854,Love these gel polishes!  Can't beat them for the price!,5
8855,true colors on these that I bought but it peels off after 3 days.,2
8856,Not so great. Peeled up after the 1st 24 hours.,1
8857,nice colors but they don't last long starts cracking in couple of days,3
8858,The colors are no where near the same as picture shown.,1
8859,Bought it for a friend and she said she liked it.,5
8860,This took forever to get and then when I got it the color was not how it shows in the picture NOT WORTH THE WAIT,1
8861,I bought this specifically for the white and yet somehow I have grey instead! ,1
8862,Love it for my business Blossom by BeBe custom press on nails,5
8863,"Nice colors, I have 4 layers in this picture.",5
8864,Loved the colors! Just like in the picture. I recommend them.,5
8865,Don't let this TINY bottle fool you! There is even LESS product inside. It's probably about a quarter of the way full....,1
8866,Fast delivery.  Bottles are tiny but polish has worn well.  Takes longer to cure - 2-3 cycles under LED lamp,4
8867,"The blues are vey transparent. If u layer them over a black or white, they look nice.",4
8868,"Polish is decent quality, but the color match is a little off.",3
8869,The colors are so perfect for the summer! The colors are slightly different in color but still beautiful nontheless.,5
8870,"Not gel. Regular pain. Scam. Dont buy. Check photo for next day after application, and yes I usef an UV light",1
8871,"Two of the polishes, the glitter and white, were hardened blocks, completely unusable. You get what you pay for.",2
8872,"These are very nice polishes for the price! My favorite is the gold glitter, but all the colors are great too!",4
8873,Box came Open and a nail Polish was split all over it's fake don't buy,1
8874,Its not the best quality it but you get what u pay for..,2
8875,It's definitely not a prime item. SHIPMENT WILL TAKE more than 2 months to the US.,1
8876,Very thick polish. Much thicker than the sensationail brand. This made it difficult to apply without getting it all over my cuticles,3
8877,This gel top coat is good! I haven't had any issues using it.,5
8878,"product is as discribed,,,,however it took 2 months to arrive.  disappointed.",3
8879,Polish was goopy and would not coat properly. Very disappointing.,1
8880,Disappointed that the white didn't come and that was the reason I chose this set,1
8881,The product description was inaccurate as the colors do not match the pictures. Besides the white all the colors were nearly the same shade of pink.,1
8882,Colors not as identical as the picture. Overall ok.,4
8883,Colors are watered down. I had to apply several coats to get desired coverage. Not happy with the purchase. What a waste!,1
8884,These colors are not true to what you get butthe polish isn't bad.,2
8885,Bad quality. Too thick and doesn't go well on the nails.,1
8886,"Colors are not as advertised. This is supposed to be the darker color, instead it looks brown with a hint of purple.",3
8887,I hate this so much! The top coat doesnt cure at all! I tried for 10 minutes and it was just a sticky liquid mess.,1
8888,"Only lasts a week, but for the price and the shine i give it a 4 star.",4
8889,The no wipe to coat didn't come with this product. Everything else did. The polish gaps. But two or three coats should work,2
8890,I have not been successful with curing this top and base coat with a UV light,1
8891,"Ive had good luck with this brand in the past, but the colors shown are not what I received.all pastel/neon, and almost translucent.",1
8892,"Some of my most long lasting polish, colors are pretty true to what I expected",5
8893,I love love the colors they are very vibrant.  However the polish is really thick and hard to get an even coat on the nail.,3
8894,"Worked great! Went on beautifully,  cured great! Amazing deal for the price! Highly recommend!",5
8895,"Very good gel polish,would def. recommend ,stays for 2 weeks no problem!",5
8896,"The black and white speckled is a waste, but the other colors are nice.",4
8897,"colors are too transparent, does't look like the photo.",2
8898,"Bottles are small, i have had better luck with this brand then brands from sallys! Love all the colors!",5
8899,Only last between 7 to 9 days like the most.,3
8900,"Really gorgeous colors. Stays on, chip-free for at least a week",5
8901,Nice colors. Easy to use. The glitter polish probably should be used over a color.,4
8902,"Great quality, just not the vibrant colors I would like.",4
8903,This product is horrible.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  It doesn't deserve 1 star.,1
8904,"Good for starers, make sure to fully cure each layer and paint on thin layers!",4
8905,Goes on smoothly. Love the colors. Looks really pretty on and stays on for two weeks-ish.,5
8906,Came in Time it was supposed to but only one of the colors was close to correct from my order very disappointed,1
8907,The colors are too light. I had to put too many layers on to get a full coverage.,2
8908,I love the colours but the bottles are to to to to to small I give the bottles 0,2
8909,I love this polish this is a great deal I will be ordering again...,5
8910,Peels easily . The colors I wished I could have picked each one individually the sets they have to choose from don't have all the colors I like,3
8911,doesn't even stay for a week..no idea why...its cheap.i know..but comes out too fast too easy..whats wrong?,2
8912,They do not last that long and takes up at least three coats to make it opaque. Overall it good though.,3
8913,Very poor product. It does not dry with the UV light. Don't waste your money,1
8914,It seemed like the product was fried up and one was damaged upon it's arrival,1
8915,Very high quality. Will buy again. Photo is at week 2,5
8916,"I took over 5 coats just to get a color pay off, it was rather streaky too.",1
8917,"Great product, this lasts about 7-10 days before it starts to peel.",5
8918,So cute used this for Halloween. Everyone loved it.,5
8919,Long and bendable. For my 6 year olds costume.,5
8920,Great product. Toned and firmed and reduced the appearance of cellulite on my legs and thighs,5
8921,this cream i like this but it takes some time to work smells good,5
8922,Great product!!! Work well for my needs!!,5
8923,This product is new to me and I thought I would give it a try!  I am loving it!  I would def recommend!,4
8924,love this stuff absorbs superfast and leaves skin smooth and taut,5
8925,Don`t see much changes. Better then nothing - but it`s not a miracle product.,3
8926,Still applying the cream. I didn't know it was only 1 bottle. Picture show 3.,4
8927,I may be crazy but I swear within a week this product started working.  I wish I had taken before and after pics!,5
8928,Been using for about 2 weeks and I have NIT noticed any difference,3
8929,I saw  a  difference in  my  skin by the end of the  week.  I  love the  product,4
8930,This product is non-greasy and odor free. Hoping for some results soon.,4
8931,"I just started using it, however by the reviews I'm expecting great results.",5
8932,Too early to see real results but it leaves my skin super soft! Smells good too.,5
8933,This is crazy. How can you expect a feet back after one days use ,1
8934,"no bad odor, perfect consistency, and minimal ingredients! only been using for 2 days and can already see a difference!",5
8935,Just started using this. It is very light and smells great,5
8936,"Not impressed :(
Another one bites th' dust.",1
8937,"not sure on the results yet, i will keep using it",4
8938,Awesome product!!!!  Love love love it!  I can already see a difference!  Been using 3 weeks now.  Just ordered another bottle!,5
8939,"Not enough product to tell difference, probably would have to buy 5",3
8940,I use this product every single day - I love it!,5
8941,Came chunky and separated. I'm returning it. Too bad I have to go through the hassle of returning. Should be able to just toss it,1
8942,This stuff sucks.  Was all clumpy and separated and didn't shrink or blur my pores at all.  Actually made my skin look worse!,1
8943,This was not usable. It was separated. Liquid just poured out of the container. Do not buy this it is a waste of money,1
8944,Love this product and it was received in very timely manner.,5
8945,The mixture comes out of the tube in a burst and is watery..,3
8946,Love this product!  It is the only pore refiner that works great with my rosacea,5
8947,Must be expired. Not the correct texture. I have bought from store before and know what the texture should be like.,1
8948,"Good buy compared to stores, and will purchase this product again!",5
8949,"Works great but has some product stability issues, but again, Loreal seems to have discontinued so I bought several.  Sigh.",5
8950,this product came an was goopy and watery  I would not recommend it!,1
8951,"As many others said, both of the products were separated so when you try to squeeze it out you get a big liquidy mess. Very dissappointed.",1
8952,leaves the eyebrows red tone. The gel is two-step application and difficult to apply,2
8953,"Great find. Works great on my eyebrows. Delighted to find the product w/more than one application as those purchased at drug stores, etc.",5
8954,Works perfect but the color in person is different than the picture.,4
8955,Very happy with this 2-toned variety! I'm decluttering my makeup collection & like to color code my product types. Thanks for a great experience!,5
8956,I depotted everything except my absolute favorite palettes. Way more convenient than having it all separate.,5
8957,Obsessed! and it came with stickers for non-magnetic shadows ! about 20 in total!,5
8958,Got them from my husband for Christmas and I absolutely love them!!,5
8959,Nice light purple cover. The magnet holds well.  It came with magnets to stick on your makeup if you need to. Great product.,5
8960,Love the z palettes!! they are so easy to clean and make my eyeshadows nice and organized.,5
8961,These are great in theory... but my powders always break. They slide around because the magnetic tape ons do not stay.,3
8962,"This palette was amazing, legit zpalette, the color is beautiful & it came to my house extremely fast.  ",5
8963,"So cute, love this pallette for storing individual pans in! So convienent and easy to store.",5
8964,Love it. Condenses eye shadow and blush pans.  Eliminates bulk and clutter,5
8965,Awesome! I had some blushes and eye shadows that I depotted and this worked perfectly! No complaints. Great deal!!,5
8966,Very disappointing.  Just a couple of small sheets of zig zag tape.,2
8967,"These work perfect for any colored polish. Great quality and fast shipping, they also sent me a few other designs too!",5
8968,Great stencil.  Works for both adults and kids.  Sticks well without slipping from the nail for easy nail polish application.,5
8969,"So easy to use, never had a problem. I always order from whats up nails",5
8970,"Great product! Sticky enough to make crisp lines, but not too stick put pull off base coat of paint.",5
8971,Works great! Easy to use to make cool designs.  Fair price.,5
8972,FAST & FABULOUS!!! I will order more from Whatsup nails,5
8973,These are pretty and I had no problems sticking them on!,5
8974,Works as expected. Does have super long cord that is always in the way.,4
8975,This is the best type of makeup bag ever! The only thing i don't like is the string is too long.,5
8976,As expected! Very handy to open the entire way and be able to see all of your products and not have to dig!,5
8977,This little bag has saved me time every day. No more exasperated digging for products! Love it & plan to give them to everyone as gifts.,5
8978,LOVE this!! Do NOT spend more money on another brand!,5
8979,Other cinch totes were up to $18 which is ridiculous this does the same thing at a great deal!,5
8980,Very attractive and very useful.  I have given many of these as gifts and everyone loves them.,5
8981,I bought these for a trip but they are sooo convenient - I've left everything in them and use them every day! : )),5
8982,Works well.  Is larger than I thought but not a problem.  It fits in a travel bag but it is too large for a purse.,4
8983,"Haven't traveled with it, but it looks like it would be great!",5
8984,Love. The case allows me to carry this in my purse and not worry that the file will get broken.  Great buy,5
8985,not really happy with this file...too rough...does not leave smooth nails...won't reorder.,2
8986,"these are very nice, glad I ordered 2 of them.",5
8987,The glass file is exactly as described.  I absolutely love it.,5
8988,File is ok but arrived with part of pink area broken off (jagged break so I had to tape it to avoid cutting myself).,3
8989,"Extremely high quality for the right price.  And, I already have two other glass nail files that I can compare this to.",5
8990,I love the way this looks but love the filing capacity more. Works the nail to a perfect shine!,5
8991,The glass is too thick to file my nails very well.,2
8992,"It is a little too thick for my liking.  Was as presented, just not for me.",3
8993,It didn't work as well as I thought it would.,4
8994,"Loved this, It really kept my nails from breaking.",5
8995,"Case often comes apart in my purse, file works okay.",3
8996,"The product arrived as stated, & is a tremendous asset in nail care",5
8997,Love the file. The case makes it easy to carry in your purse.,5
8998,"Does not last.  I had it for 10 days, and it was already worn smooth on both sides.  I would not waste my money.",1
8999,Christmas gift for daughter...she loves these files and I'm glad I found one with a case so it won't break in her purse!!,5
9000,I love that you never have to replace the file. The case is a great idea for carrying in your handbag and to prevent breaking.,5
9001,used glass files before and they worked great.  These take too long to file,2
9002,"I am enjoying this nail file.  I have very thin nails, and this does not leave ragged edges.",5
9003,I am very pleased with the quality of the file and case. I especially like that the case stays together.,4
9004,"Amazing!!!!  I wouldn't have believed it, but the file REALLY works!!",5
9005,"I like the glass nail file so much that I bought 2, one for myself and my mother.",5
9006,I had very hard natural nails and this file works the best of any file I have found so far. Love it,5
9007,I have a lot of sinus issues and this does help when my head is stuffed up!,5
9008,It's just a natural smelling oil. I would not say it has anything to do with weight loss.,3
9009,Did not do what I expected.  Not worth the money.,1
9010,Looks just like the picture. Great quality. Catches on clothes a lot though and longer than my pants.,4
9011,its reallly pretty not too flashy but not to dainty i wore it to the beach and its just fine really comfortable under clothes also,5
9012,This is my favorite belly ring and it's really pretty and sturdy,5
9013,"I got this belly ring and the next day, the tassels broke off. Quality was horrible",1
9014,Could not get the top ball to screw off. Pointless waited a month for something I can't use.,1
9015,I am in love with this belly ring. It shipped fast! I will def buy again.,5
9016,I ordered 2 of these. Both droken after a couple weeks. Very cute while they lasted though.,2
9017,"The tassel fell off after a few times of wearing it. Otherwise, very pretty!",3
9018,I bought two.....two in a pkg in case they broke being only 50 something cents a piece! So very cute!,5
9019,Very comfortable. Don't even seem like you have it on.,4
9020,These toe rings are very pretty. I love them! Yet today one of them broke in half!!,5
9021,nice but it pinches a little bit to keep it in place.,4
9022,Cute rings but very cheap. Turned my toes green.,1
9023,I ordered this item on June 7th and received it on the 18th. Ths design is ok but it's cheaply made and small.,3
9024,Cute an adjustable size an it comes with two of the same ones,5
9025,Thinner & smaller than I expected but okay for the price,3
9026,These turned color fast was only able to wear once.  Disappointed defiantly,1
9027,Cute and very reasonable price but it turned color on me about a month later. I was disappointed on that part.,3
9028,Snapped in half right when I got it!! Don't purchase ,1
9029,Oddly stiff for cheap metal. It stays in place quite well and hasn't turned my skin off colors. Good buy in my opinion.,5
9030,Actually my 20 year old daughter bought these and I have seen her wear them several times already so I guess she likes them!,5
9031,You get what you pay for . Super cute but as like all metal it turns your toes green,1
9032,"Beautiful.
I have baby fine hair and yet this holds my hair in place nicely.",5
9033,It's great to find beautiful clips that don't cost too much.  Any of them could be used for hair or scarf clip.,5
9034,Gorgeous and very vintage; it's hard to find hair accessories in black... this one goes so well with my outfits,5
9035,"Pretty doesn't do you any good if that think doesn't work!
Very heavy and slippery!",1
9036,"THIS ITEM TOOK OVER A MONTH TO GET TO ME! ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT IT. OVERALL IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON!!
Thanks!!",5
9037,Looks better in picture something I would not wear but I let my 5 year old niece wear it,1
9038,"This is a really cute, fun necklace. It's lightweight and looks great on.",4
9039,"Super cute style and color. It seems a bit fragile, but for the price, it was awesome!",4
9040,You get what you pay for. It looks and feels cheaper than the picture. It ships from China.,1
9041,Arrived on time. Wearing it right now. It's lovely. Don't usually wear gold colored jewelry but this one caught my eye.,5
9042,"I love this necklace! Though it did tarnish after one accidental trip in the water, it's completely ruined now.",5
9043,pretty but turned in just a few days. waste of money,1
9044,Pretty. Doesn't fall as well as the picture makes it look though,4
9045,"Not what I expected,  but when I compare picture to product it's right on. Look carefully before ordering!!!!",2
9046,Very pretty on but after a few months it becomes Rusty and smells,3
9047,"Is not like this picture, is different an low quality.",2
9048,A lovely item and a very fair price.  Thank you for your generous submission to Amazon of this product.,5
9049,bit cheap and was not as long nor hang on neck as pictured,3
9050,"Didn't meet my expectations, broken and miss pieces.",1
9051,Very cheap and turned a dark brown tarnish within a few wears.,1
9052,I love the necklace. Only 3 stars because it discolored.,3
9053,"Cheap looking and the wire is turning brown looking, not what I expected.",1
9054,"Very pretty design, but the ""gold"" turns pretty quickly.",3
9055,I wear this often. It's a simple necklace perfect for summer outfits.,4
9056,"Very colorful, feminine and delicate. Like wearing with my plain tee shirts.",5
9057,"Cute, simple, and $2.99. A little trendy piece of costume jewelry. Came very tangled but straightened out nicely. Great for summer.",4
9058,"I AM SO SO DISAPPOINTED. I WORE THIS ONCE AND IT COMPLETELY TURNED. DOES NOT LOOK GOLD, IT TURNED RUSTY LOOKING........SO UPSET",1
9059,It was a kinda cute for a minute..then it broke.,1
9060,Not the same necklace as described in the picture. It is a cheap replica. Didn't even come close!,1
9061,Love it! Great value!!! Does not get tangled as much as my other layering necklaces do. Perfect for summer!,5
9062,"This was a cute necklace, not very good quality as it broke after 3 wearigs, also the colors were not natural looking.",3
9063,I'm not sure what this is made out of...it turned a greenish color after an hour of wear,1
9064,You get what you pay for.  This doesn't look as cute as it does in the picture.  It looks more like 99 cent store jewelry.,2
9065,I like this dainty jewelry and it is light weight.  Hangs just right with my tops. and can be dressed  up or down.  Well pleased!,4
9066,"It broke the first day I wore it. Can't expect too much at that price, I guess. The strands kept getting tangled as well.",1
9067,"So good for the price, but of course it looks cheap.",4
9068,Broke as soon as I tried to get on :-),1
9069,"Not only is this necklace beautiful, it is sexy! Love to wear it with black or dark colors! A must have!",5
9070,It's pretty but it didn't last long worn one time it broke,1
9071,The chain on the top part was too long just over overlapped onto the bottom section and looked bad,2
9072,Very light & feminie with a touch of elegance to your summer wardrobe.,4
9073,"This necklace is beautiful, but gave me a rash :( Really bummed because it's a great length and really pretty.",2
9074,Delicate and lovely.  Perfect for a white tee type of day,5
9075,necklace was assembled wrong. Had to take it apart and had to reassemble it so it would look as pictured. Was not expecting that.,1
9076,it's a really cute necklace.  up against clothing it looks really nice.,3
9077,Threw it away after weari it 2 days. The shiny metal changed color and turned brown. Don't bother...,1
9078,Quite a value. Very pretty-not sure how long it will hold up but I love it!,5
9079,I love this necklace so much I just bought another one as a spare.....and may buy a third. *smile* Shipping was quicker than expected.,5
9080,"Nothing like the picture. Also it's really cheap, one small tug would probably break the chain.",1
9081,"I would definitely recommend, it's same as in picture.",5
9082,"For the price is is cute, but not durable. It broke the 2nd time wore it and is already turning my skin green ",3
9083,pretty for cheap jewelry!! I've already worn it a few times and got complements...It gets tangled easily while you wear it,5
9084,look great - can't wait to start using them -,5
9085,I use them for spraying olive oils. They don't clog up and look nice next to the stove.,5
9086,"These spray bottles are more for looks than function. The spray is pretty week, and with minimal use, they seem to keep losing power.",3
9087,"These are nice bottles to mix essential oil cleaning products, except the spray trigger is not optimal. Hard to hold and have a continuous spray pattern",4
9088,"One of the spray bottles doesn't spray, so I was disappointed in that, but they're very cute.",4
9089,"A bit hard to hold on too, but they do the job.  I'm using then with cooking oil to save calories.",4
9090,"I love these! Glass is thick but not too heavy, perfect size for my lavender air freshener and my vinegar bathroom cleaner!",5
9091,"Good price and I was satisfied with the product, thank you.",5
9092,"I use this for spraying at my cat if she misbehave. After using it for a week, the spray stopped functioning....Very disappointed.",3
9093,"Great looking and functioning bottles.  I had one bottle arrive with a broken spray nozzle, and the company quickly replaced the nozzle.",4
9094,Love the bottles!  Do you supply more in bulk?!,5
9095,Love these bottles. Mist is strong and consistent. Bottles look great also.,5
9096,Cute glass bottles; love the super fine mist the sprayers give off and the reusable labels are a nice touch,5
9097,I bought these bottles to make an my own room freshener spray and they work perfect. The glass is pretty and the sprayer works well.,5
9098,"Great spray bottles... I only wish the liquid came out a little stronger.  It sprays out a light, fuzzy mist.",4
9099,"These are very nice. Sprayer works well so far, and has a nice spray.",4
9100,These bottles work great! They are what I expected and the labels are really cute.,5
9101,Give me a skin irritation and it's too small for them in,2
9102,does nothin to urn fat. It is uncomfortable and you don't really feel the fat burning,1
9103,It hurt when you remove it from your skin its just feel like a plaster and i didn't feel any change in the skjn texture or fat reduction,1
9104,I am not sure if I saw result but it does not irritate my skin.,3
9105,this patch may be good for lady's during their period. it heats your stomach but doesn't decrease your stomach fat,2
9106,Painful to take off didn't see any change . DON'T buy this wasted my money.,1
9107,I am very unhappy because this product burned my skin and I never lost any inches ,1
9108,stays in place. i don't like that the dye comes off of the patch.,3
9109,Don't be fooled by the reviews.  This does not work.,1
9110,It works but you have to keep on using to keep results,2
9111,"I love this stuff,  i saw the difference after using it for 2 weeks. It really works!",5
9112,Did. It work at all! DONT NOT BUY!,1
9113,"Did not stick very well at all, espically around the edges. I am returning to Amazon.",1
9114,Absolut waste of money. My stomach got hot and that's about it.,1
9115,I needed to lose weight ASAP for a special event and these wraps were perfect I'm on my second box and I'm still seeing fast results !,4
9116,This product really works.  Am very happy with it.  Have already lost a little more than an inch,5
9117,so far works great and I am very happy with the results.,5
9118,The product immediately toned my abdomen after three applications. I would definitely recommend this I talked to anyone trying to reduce inches and tone the abdomen.,4
9119,"Have only been using for a week,but seems to be helping",3
9120,"Comfortable, easy to put on, stays on the entire time. Used one time. Haven't seen any results as of yet.",4
9121,I just received this product and have used it twice. I see a bit of a difference and it does make your skin fill smooth after application!,4
9122,"Have not finished the first set yet, so far it appears to be working.",4
9123,Have used 3 so far and haven't seen a difference.,1
9124,I saw no difference even after using 10 of them. I followed all directions and nothing.,1
9125,"I really love this product, not only does it work but you can apply it and take it off so easily!",5
9126,It works better along with workout.  Would be nice if it is longer to cover more of the waistline.  It is very easy to apply.,3
9127,Not very good. Do not bother to buy it.,1
9128,"I was skeptical at first, but these really seem to work!  My tummy area seems to be flatter and more toned after 3 uses!",4
9129,Paid for next day air and got it four days later..... As far as the product it worked so no complaint there.,3
9130,"Used all 5 applications on 2 different days, and have seen ZERO results. Super disappointed, and wishing I hadn't spend the money.",1
9131,"Timely delivery, product arrived as described,  easy to use.",3
9132,I like the result after I use the wrap but I am not sure about long time results. So far I used them twice. Very fast shipping,4
9133,Very easy to use and stayes on easy .. Ur able to work with it on and has a warm sensation. When it's working. Loved it..,4
9134,Seems like they are working. Stomach area seems tighter. Hopefully will notice more in the next couple of applications.,4
9135,I love these! I love the cooling/tingling sensation and I am actually seeing results!,5
9136,"Love  this product. Make sure you drink water
I've lost 2 inches so far - I definitely want more",5
9137,"Total waste of money, I used all 10 of these and got 0 results from it.",1
9138,"This is my second order,  and I love it, these patch help me to burn fat.",5
9139,Didn't realize you can't use this while breastfeeding so I'll have to wait a bit before I try it!,3
9140,"i used now the 5th wrap , with no results ... I have no idea when I will feel body shape",2
9141,These things don't work.  I saw no difference in my waist. Wish I could get my money back.,1
9142,It's all a bunch of hooey.  Does NOTHING don't waste your money.,2
9143,"DO NOT BUY
Absolutely worthless - did not work at all!",1
9144,Does not work at all. Does absolutely nothing!!,1
9145,It hurts when u take it off. Sending it back!,1
9146,Should be used a few times depending on desired results. Of course eat healthy drink plenty of water. Follow the instructions.,4
9147,Please pay attention to the reviews! The only negative reviews are verified purchases. The rest are not to be trusted!,1
9148,Doesn't feel like it has any scrubbing effect and burns red spots,4
9149,Like this mask but I like my homemade one better.,4
9150,My wife love the mud mask. you will be most pleased with this brand and product.,5
9151,"This mask rivals other expensive ones that I have used, it made my skin feel so soft and glowy.",5
9152,"Goes on smoothly, not chunky. Very happy with it.",5
9153,This body butter is fair enough. Not too happy with the scent though.,3
9154,Wife loves this stuff.  Makes her happy.  Will be back for more.,5
9155,Fresh fruity smell. My skin is very dry and i found the moisture it delivered was not long lasting.,3
9156,Not what i expected.  It was more like thinly sliced duct tape,1
9157,"horrible , horrible, horrible quality! The only reason why i put (1) star is because there isn't an option to select ""none""",1
9158,"These are great, I love the amount you get and the price you pay. They worked well and I will use them all the time!!",5
9159,I bought this for a friend and she loved it. It's exactly as pictured and is really cute.,4
9160,These bottles leak where the black top meets the bottom.,2
9161,"Broad base,  large volume, frothy output.  Totally satisfied.",5
9162,"Junk.  only 3 of them worked initially, and all stopped after about a week.",1
9163,I bought 4 of these and with in 2 weeks they all stopped working,1
9164,They leak just a little bit when you squeeze them. But otherwise they work like they should :),3
9165,They don't work. Contents come out between top and bottle and not through the pump.,1
9166,These arrived timely and work well.  They are nice looking.  I have zero complaints - am happy with the product.,5
9167,Awesome.  My daughter loves the ears and tail.  Good quality.,5
9168,"The tail is SO soft and the ears are cute.
Though I would have to figure out how to them on. I still love them!",5
9169,I wore these for halloween and they arrived about 2 weeks before the actual date (: very pleased,4
9170,My granddaughter wanted to get face piercings so I sent these past ons to her to use instead.  She got a big KICK out of them.,5
9171,I love love my face gems. I was able to reuse each 10 times so I got a lot of wear. Super cute!,5
9172,It's okay.  Cream is cream.  I can't tell the difference on my 71-year-old neck.,4
9173,It's a cream. Nothing notable about it and I doubt I'd purchase it again.,3
9174,better than products costing 100 or more and the best neck tightening .,5
9175,Have used nectifirm in the past. This is not as good. It is just cheaper.,3
9176,I have been using this for about a week now and I love it.  I think it has already helped with the lines on my neck.,5
9177,Nice cream; no change; smell not wonderful but okay.,4
9178,"I really can't tell that this product does anything besides generally moisturize.  On the plus side, it wasn't very expensive.",3
9179,Great product that seems to tighten up that loose skin under jawline. Very rich and absorbs quickly.,5
9180,It does seem to work.  I feel tightening each time I put it on.  I'll have to use it longer to give a better review.,4
9181,Just completed using one full jar and I have not noticed one bit of difference in the skin tone on my neck.,2
9182,"not very impressed, like another product better, you get what you paid for.",2
9183,"Improvement visible in a Week, wrinkles on my neck are reduced and neck is firmer. I recommend.",4
9184,It is a great neck firming cream.  I haven't discovered any miracles with it but my neck looks smoother.,5
9185,"Product feels a little sticky to the touch, and so far I haven't seen any improvements in my skin!",3
9186,Wonderful light feel on skin. Pleasant smell. Would recommend for anyone who is no longer 20 something.  I received this at a reduced rate.,5
9187,"Received this item in exchanged for my review.

have noticed my neck and double chin going away. thank you so much.",5
9188,Leaves my skin smooth ans soft. My  jaws seem to be tightening and I can see a glow on my skin,5
9189,"My face was yellow orange after removing, didn't see any benefits,  very messy, had to use coffee grounds scrUbuntu to remove discoloration",2
9190,I thought this has a creamy texture. But it is so hard. Cant apply properly to the face. I do like the fragrance though.,2
9191,OMG! This was so oily and messy.  I returned it.,1
9192,Great starter for beginners. Has a variety of stampers to find what you like.,5
9193,I bought this as a gift and she liked it.,4
9194,Most are great for the price. Have problems with the ends staying in the larger black with red stamper. They like to fall out.,4
9195,"Works great! The designs are super cute! Surprisingly, I did not really need to prime the stampers before use.",5
9196,"Love all the stampers and scrapers.  Not impressed with the plate it came with, could not get any polish to transfer from it.",3
9197,Very cheaply made. The stamp etchings are not deep enough to gather polish to actually stamp.,1
9198,I just got my order and im missing the pink stamper and my stamping plate! I want the rest of my order!!!!,1
9199,But with a file I can smooth them out and still wear them if I can find a big back to keep them in.,3
9200,Love these earrings they are very pretty and feminine. Love the color gotten tons of compliments.,5
9201,"Such beautiful earrings. Just as pictured, even with the small detail on the leaves. :)",5
9202,"Very feminine and elegant, can't wait to wear them.",5
9203,Love the color of these earrings. The new back is fantastic,5
9204,I've gotten compliments from friends and strangers every time I've worn these. They are a bit heavy but not so much that they are uncomfortable.,5
9205,"I bought it as a present for my daughter, she just love it.",5
9206,Very nice little mirror.  Serves my needs quite well.,5
9207,I have bought several makeup mirrors and this one is by far my favorite.,5
9208,The light is too bright so it blinds you when you're trying to use it,1
9209,The color looks great and it has a right size for traveling.,5
9210,Love the color but I didn't realize how much the shipping was until after it was sent - not worth it. You could just go to NYX.com,3
9211,exactly what I expected for the price of these. the brushes fall apart and the bristles fall out,3
9212,"some brushes are useable, some are just odd, but good variety for the price and amount of brushes you get.",3
9213,They had strong scent that stayed for a couple days...they are ok I guess,3
9214,"The only downside to these were the fact that they took forever to come in. Other than that, they are pretty good brushes.",4
9215,Needed some brushes and I like the variety this set has.,5
9216,Not happy !! You should not be scaling this to people!,4
9217,Not really what the picture looks like AT ALL mostly all the same brushes. I don't recommend,1
9218,I love them but I didn't get the color I wanted. And they came 3 weeks early.,4
9219,"Two of each brush except for foundation, they smell weird, plus side they came early and there good quality brushes, good purchase ",4
9220,Overall the makeup brushes are as expected for the price paid.,4
9221,I like it much better than I expected. I am going to use it regularly. I hope it will reduce my aging process.,5
9222,Been using this for a month now and do not see a difference. Disappointing,1
9223,I'm seeing a noticeable difference in my sun spots on chest.  Some are completely gone and others are fading nicely,5
9224,Been using this for a while now and I'm kinda noticing a difference it is fading my dark spots slowly,5
9225,I can't really see a difference  I've been using most days.  Not sure I can recommend.,3
9226,"""After the second application I could tell the difference, I would recommend this product. Thank you for following up!""",2
9227,"I am trying this serum for almost a month, but I don't see any different in my dark spot, so I won't buy it again",2
9228,i used this product as directed for 4 weeks and did not notice a difference!,1
9229,Works even better if you apply Venin Royal dark spot corrector after the liquid !!!,5
9230,Sorry to say this product did not work on the dark spot on my face.,1
9231,I had a brown spot on my forehead. I used this product 3XADay.  It merely lighten the spot.  Still the same size-just lighter,2
9232,I've been using this for about 2 months and haven't seen much difference. Maybe my skin is too old.,3
9233,I just got it a couple of days ago and I've already seen a huge improvement. Highly recommend.,5
9234,Seems to be working well - just ordered another. Price is good,5
9235,"I used this product for over a month, and see absolutely no effect.  Don't waste your money.",1
9236,Great serum for age spots! Glad that I ordered this. Nice feeling and absorbs completely.,5
9237,it definitely lightened up the sun spot i had on my forehead!!,4
9238,No improvement on my dark spots after 2 months of use. Moving on to another product.,1
9239,I used the whole bottle and saw no improvement in my hyperpigmentation. Very disappointed in the outcome.,1
9240,"Smells good, makes my skin soft, not correcting dark spots.",3
9241,Used for three weeks as instructed with no visible fading of spots (not even the lighter spots).,2
9242,Very happy whit the delivery .....this product do not work for me ,2
9243,This product us lightening my age spots.  Feels good on my skin.,5
9244,wonders of marketing.  doesn't work.  doesn't do anything after using nightly for over 2 mo.,1
9245,I have used the entire bottle....used it every morning and night faithfully....and saw no improvement.,1
9246,It really works.. my spots are not removed 100% but they are lighter already.,5
9247,I used it on dark spots for about 30 days and haven't seen any difference. :(,1
9248,I am sorry I am not at all happy with this it didn't remove or fade my dark spot.,1
9249,Did not work at all and I gave it at least a month. Very disappointed and feel like I was taken advantage of and given false hope.,1
9250,Haven't seen any remarkable results... too soon to tell.,3
9251,I've using this product for over four weeks. I have yet to see any results. It's not worth the price.,1
9252,"Within 28 days I was seeing visible results. Fine lines had decreased, my skin tone was even, and my skin was more radiant.",5
9253,This product seems to be working and I will be ordering another bottle soon.,5
9254,I have tried lots of different beauty products that claimed to remove dark circles. I have to admit that I was impressed with only this one.,5
9255,"This Dark Spot Corrector makes your skin feel soft and supple.
I have been using it for some time, and the results are real.",5
9256,Does not do that great of a job on removing the glue it was bought for and burns slightly.,3
9257,This product is needed to remove the for with ease. Didn't realize it was so small but great for travel in my makeup kit,4
9258,In my case it was a Halloween-only product (although we've saved it for future use)... worked great!,5
9259,I love this sponge.  It makes my skin feel so smooth and clean.  Finally someone brought this to the states from Europe....,5
9260,"Perfect, perfect, perfect for EO's.  Great quality.",5
9261,While these are 10ml bottles.they are not standard diameter and are not interchangeable with other bottles of same capacity. Will not use this company again.,1
9262,Happy with how well the roller balls work and the general quality of the glass bottles.,5
9263,This wax smells horrible!  I can't use it!  Cosmetic grade?  I think not!,1
9264,great product - the lids are tight and ball rolls well.  Great deal for 12!,5
9265,Love these. They look great and do not leak.,5
9266,They have worked well to make rollerballs with essential oils.,5
9267,These are great for just mixing up a little pain relief blend.,5
9268,They are nice bottles. I love the color. The rollerball doohickey is a tight squeeze and none have leaked so far. They perform as expected.,5
9269,Great roller bottles. Easy to fill and place lid on. Will def order again when I need more!,5
9270,"Overall, nice glass vials. But rollers could be better.",3
9271,The most affordable roller bottles I've found. Took off one star because 1 cap could not be screwed on because of a defect.,4
9272,I wish these were more consistent in delivering the contents to you skin. It's either gushing liquid or nothing's coming out at all.,3
9273,very easy to use with essential oils. great for blending  and the contents last a long time.,5
9274,I really like these so far for my essential oils. I mix a carrier of coconut oil and these don't leak and mix nice.,5
9275,Perfect for homemade rollerblend recipes. They work perfect.  No leaking.,5
9276,"Can't beat the price!  These work great with my essential oils.  Not quite as good as the metal top ones, but way cheaper.",5
9277,Have bought these a few times and they work great - no issues,5
9278,Works perfectly with my essential oil mixes.  Very happy with my purchase.  Need to order more. Only have two left.,5
9279,"They have been perfect for the essential oil mixes I make and give away.  Great for perfum oils, too!",5
9280,My hair is too thin I could not get it to look right. But my husband had fun with it.,3
9281,nice hair but too thin and doesn't blend with my hair.,3
9282,No stars. The hair can not be heated and is plastic,1
9283,Terrible quality. Looks like plastic Barbie hair. The halo band is huge and non adjustable so it skips and slides,1
9284,Very happy with these bottles!  And their cute to boot ,5
9285,The tops don't screw on properly thus not giving a good seal,2
9286,These are my favorite roller bottles! I love them. Easy to use/create blends and pretty.,5
9287,Cute bottles! Ordered 2 sets and was not disappointed!,4
9288,"Every review here was given the product free for their ""honest opinion"" of the product. How about hearing from someone who didn't get bribed.",1
9289,I wore your product to bed.  I had no problems sleeping with the applicator on.  I woke up feeling good.  And my skin looked amazing.,4
9290,It's a bit messy to apply but a little Saran Wrap goes a long way. Helped me sweat a storm :),5
9291,"I like the product, and like the resolves and want to try it again!! It work great!!",3
9292,Not worth all the hype just made my skin feel nice,3
9293,I used the product as directed on my abdomen area. I used all three of the wraps and did not notice any change.,3
9294,"does work but not as good as another brand
lil messer too",3
9295,These suck. Don't waste your time. It was a total waste of money.,1
9296,Its ok. It would not stay in place unless I put surround wrap which was a pain,3
9297,"they somewhat worked, i religiously followed instructions and it didn't seem to do much. love the product though.",4
9298,don't waste your money ! its a scam it does not work,1
9299,"It doesn't work too much , I fell the same thing before i uses them",2
9300,It didn't work for me. I was really hoping it would.,2
9301,It works great on me and my sons hair y'all should buy this sponge brush is great,5
9302,Does what it suppose to do. Curls my hair no problem and I have very thick hair.,5
9303,This product works great on my sons hair. His barber suggested it for him. Great product. I will suggest this to buy.,5
9304,"Holds up nicely, lasted about 7 months before needed replacing but it is affordable and efficient.",5
9305,It does what it's supposed to do. Arrived quicker than anticipated,5
9306,"the wavey part fell apart and got glue in my hair, in less than 2 weeks.",1
9307,My son loves this. He gets very detailed curls/locks!!!!!,5
9308,The product is great. I just have to get familiar with how it works,4
9309,Perfect! Fast delivery and item works great. Totally recommend,5
9310,It's OK but it breaks within 2 to 3 weeks of using so if you want to buy a few of them that would be a good choice,1
9311,Love it!!! Works perfectly on my sons hair!! I'm very satisfied!!!,5
9312,Wish I had read the reviews first . It worked the very first time then after that the sponge was done for smh.,1
9313,I'm sure it works as advertised. It didn't give me the look I was hoping for,3
9314,Works like any other sponge brush. But really cheaper.,5
9315,"Well, my son loves it. According to him it does what it is supposed to do.",5
9316,Great product which gave me a different styling option for my natural hair.,5
9317,My son loves this sponge does exactly what it says it's going to do,5
9318,It was a gift for my teenager who likes having another hair option.,4
9319,i ordered the hotrose for my nephew and am very pleased with it and the results it produces,5
9320,The quality of the product was a little cheaper than I expected buy it works fine,4
9321,"This doesn't seem to work as good as PERFECT, not sure why. It did an okay job.",3
9322,"It is amazing, I like the curls the brush gives me",5
9323,This is the worst product ive used. The spikes are way too soft,1
9324,I received continual packages of this item and I only ordered one.,1
9325,Came quickly and gets the job done. Good price as well. I haven't seen any reason not to recommend this to someone.,5
9326,It was suppose to ship mov. 19 but came a week early. Great sponge I love it,5
9327,love my new look......will do business again...thanks,5
9328,My son absolutely loves this sponge...very happy with it,5
9329,"Bought this my son. He has big hands, fits his palm good. He likes it a lot great fit & styles his hair well.",4
9330,It did good just left black lint in sons head.,4
9331,"I got this for my son, he loves it. Hooked his hair up for prom",5
9332,The curls were not as defined as I thought. Still a good quality brush.,3
9333,doesn't work like it states.  watched several videos and used several different products still doesn't work.,1
9334,Works as advertised and curls short to medium afro hair in seconds.,5
9335,Best sponge I used so far! The size is perfect for a quick twist up. Will order more!,5
9336,Coils my hair perfectly!!!!!!!!,5
9337,My son who is 13 states that he really likes it. So therefore I would have to say it's a good product.,3
9338,"Arrived in an envelope uncovered, no instruction, I was almost afraid to use it on my sons hair.",1
9339,Came before the stated time. I'm very satisfied.,5
9340,I bought this for my husband and he loves it. He places a little gel on the sponge and rubs his hair. It looks great.,5
9341,"Easy to use, easy to clean, exactly as described!",5
9342,I found this to be too big and bulky to use to apply self tanner. I have not used the exfoliating side yet.,2
9343,"Awesome concept, smooth ""application"" and the buffing side is nice, but way too big for my hand to really grip and make flawless.",3
9344,"Loveeee this.  Works extremely well, a staple in my exfoliation process.",5
9345,Did not easily distribute my tanning mousse. it just absorbed it all. I personally don't know how the large mitt helps smooth things easily.,1
9346,Great product.  Odorless and great results.  No residue and gentle.  I use it everyday and love the results.,5
9347,Best Product Ever.  My hair is healthier and has more body than ever before.,5
9348,This product does plump up your lips and not by drastic measures. I would definitely recommend!,4
9349,Now i have lips that can be seen....not a Huge difference but definately noticable!!!,5
9350,Didn't meet my expectations. Nice smell and nice as a lip gloss but absolutely does not plump lips.,1
9351,Absolutely amazing!!!!  You won't regret it!! Best purchase ever!!!,5
9352,The brushes are easy to use and the bag is useful. So far I love it,5
9353,Was a gift for my daughter  and she loves them.,5
9354,It is a gift so I am excited to hear how they like it.  Super fast shipping.,5
9355,These make showers an even more enjoyable experience! They last a good amount of time and just smell great.,5
9356,"I used the bag, I hung it so it wasn't directly in the water and it still doesn't work. :-(",1
9357,I love these bursts of fragrances that are set off by the heat of the shower...so refreshing...excellent!!,5
9358,"Quick Delivery, I plan on staying up all night watching YouTube tutorials :)",5
9359,I bought it for my sister and she really loved it. The price is really good comparing with the store.,5
9360,I like the darkest contour color but none of the others. The highlighter doesn't show up and the other colors are very unnatural.,3
9361,"It's great but it seems to give a more reddish tint to my skin, and needs a lot of blending.",4
9362,"Still learning to contour but is all over good palette, what i like is you can contour and use for eye shadow for all over matching!",5
9363,"Love this kit, perfect colors m, I should he ordered more",5
9364,"I got it really fast, it was everything I wanted",4
9365,Finally a contour I LOVE! Need I say more ;),5
9366,"Since I've received my mineral contouring set, it's been amazing! I love how it feels light on the skin and makes it more natural.",5
9367,I purchased this strictly to contour my round nose. Works beautifully and blends very well.,5
9368,I would say go with cream not powder. Does not blend easy and the no,1
9369,Does not blend well. The color I would use is orangey and the hi lighter does not do much either,1
9370,Love love love!!!! Still getting use to how to apply each color.,5
9371,This product is amazing and it was packaged perfectly ! No loose or broken powder at all!,5
9372,"i love it! i have medium deep skin and this is nice. not all the colors show, but the powders are beautiful.",4
9373,It's just a powder.  I thought it was a cream.  Doesn't do much. Especially for the price.,2
9374,Best contour kit I have gotten. Will buy again.,5
9375,Package came and the powders were all crushed. I did not get to try out the product for that reason.,3
9376,Came cracked and the darker shades were in little loose powders all over,2
9377,"I really like this but I do wish it came with some better instructions as I'm new to contour makeup, But a quick google search fixed that",4
9378,I am from Saudi Arabia and I recived the item in good condition .. Thanks.,5
9379,"I love this cute palette, the colors are great as well, great price as well!",5
9380,Really good product. Only issue I have is that they are a little orangy.,3
9381,Got this for my teenage daughter & loves them but some were cracked,3
9382,I bought this for my Granddaughter.  She was so excited to try it out.,5
9383,So amazing!  I LOVE this contour kit.  The colors are beautiful and it's high quality.,5
9384,Was a gift and the set arrived fast and slightly damaged,4
9385,I gave this contour kit to my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loved it...,5
9386,I got this as a Christmas gift for my teenaged daughter.  She absolutely loves it!,5
9387,I wanted an easy contouring product and this is it. I also ordered some great brushes which make the contouring very simple.,5
9388,WORST PRODUCT EVER! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ANYTHING ELSE THEN THIS!,1
9389,Absolutely love this product kinda hard to blend at first but it's still good!!!! Also was packaged very well,5
9390,Thought the product was a cream pallette versus powder.  Inexperienced with powder.,3
9391,"Great price for a nice product, have paid more for same quality",5
9392,Great contour kit ! It is easy to apply and blend. It leaves your skin looking flawless. Product came fast and in good condition,4
9393,"I think they're nice, not as stiff as id like.",4
9394,made in china......~BTWChina is graet! I love it!,4
9395,"The designs weren't deep enough to hold nail polish, it's a shame because they're great designs.",2
9396,"item does not work. blurred polish ,no design.",2
9397,Love these stamps. I have only used them on my own nails and they have worked perfect for me! Images are etched in wonderfully.,4
9398,This is a perfect combination of black and white nail art polish sticker in my collection at a very affordable price.,5
9399,I think too good to be true nothing of this works!!!,1
9400,"Liked it haven't tried it yet waiting for stamper.
The back instructions are blurry but it's simple.",5
9401,"its scratch on several of the designs, but the owl seems to be ok.",2
9402,Images are etched deep enough to get a nice stamp! Cute images too!,5
9403,Does not work at all. Should've listen to the other reviews,1
9404,"The edge is very sharp, it gave me a cut. Only two of the designs picked up properly.",2
9405,Dose not work I believe the engraving is not deep enough so you cannot transfer the design onto the nail,1
9406,Some of the etches are shallow but the large full nail designs are very  nice.  They look like lace on the nail.  Very pretty.,5
9407,"Sometimes the image did not fully get on. I am pretty sure as time goes by, I will get better at it.",4
9408,Not working for me or maybe I'm using it wrong.,1
9409,GREAT stamping plate worked the first time I used it deep engraving so the image stamps perfectly. take  a bit for shipping but well worth the wait.,5
9410,Didnt work and it sucks beacause i really liked the figures. The pictures aren't caved in.,1
9411,"DON'T REALLY LIKE IT, DON'T HATE IT, BUT NOT A HUGE FAN OVER THE PRODUCT.",2
9412,Love love the colors just a little to dry but with a clear glass over it... It's lovely ,5
9413,It leaves my lips feeling very sticky. Don't buy this if you ever want to kiss anyone!,1
9414,"sticky on the lips, colour is patchy and does not come off easily",2
9415,For the price it is ok. The colors are very true to what you see on-line.,3
9416,Most of the colors are fine except for the purple and of you later too much it can become tacky.,3
9417,"I was expecting bright red, but it turned out to be Orange instead.....and it is very sticky....although the color does stay on...",3
9418,"Love the long last color of this gloss and the variety of colors.
Great product!",5
9419,"Not a bad product, and the color seems to stay for a bit, but it makes my lips really dry.",3
9420,Very nice looking but when you put it on it sticking you lips together not a nice feeling.,2
9421,"I only received 5
09, 22, 28, 32,& 33
18 is missing",4
9422,Love these lip stains. Only draw back is that they get sticky but they do last on your lips awhile.,5
9423,"I really love these, they actually last all day unless I eat then I reapply. It's really an amazing bunch !",5
9424,The only time I had to reapply was after I had eaten and drank,5
9425,These have an odd bluish tint. I threw them away.,2
9426,"Im in love with the colors!  Great quality.  Came faster than I spected.
Buying it again for Christmas gifts",5
9427,very powerful but very heavy.  I have trouble wth the buttons being on the side.  I keep turning the dryer off when I'm holding it.,4
9428,This is my favorite cream ever! The smell is fantastic and it feels so good! Bought several for friends and family.,5
9429,Smells amazing and really works well! Worth the price!,5
9430,Would recommend that you try it.  It does help reduce the appearance of cellulite.,5
9431,Love this cream! It smells so good and really does a nice job of softening the skin. Ill be buying more when I run low.,5
9432,"Love this cream, smells so good! My husband loves it.",4

9435,Absolutely AMAZING!  Will never stop using this product!!!,5
9436,This smells amazing! I buy it just for the smell of it.,5

9440,I love this Bum Bum cream and I will be buying more!,5
9441,Doesnt seem authentic.  No shimmer and I disliked the smell.  Disappointed.  I returned it,1
9442,"Love the smell but didn't moisturizers me my legs were dry looking, very disappointed in this expensive lotion.",2
9443,I get plenty compliments on scent of the lotion and it's so cream and doesn't dry your skin .,5
9444,This stuff smells amazing.  I originally had a sample size and loved it so much I ordered the larger size.,5
9445,This lotion came unsealed...grossed me out was crusty and disgusting I ended up throwing away. I will purchase at Sephora from now on....,1
9446,Wonderful body lotion! This isn't a fake product. Smells like heaven!,5

9452,Love his crepe so much! Texture and scent are fabulous! Highly recommend.,5
9453,Best smelling and great moisturizer- smells like a day at the beach!,5

9455,"LOVE this product!! Well worth the $.  Smells delicious and buttery, and leaves skin feeling that way!",5
9456,Smells good but feeling of dryness about an hour after applying,2

9459,"Great moisturize for the body, I love the smell and leave your skin smooth.",5
9460,Love this stuff and it smells great and leaves tiny sparkles on your skin!,5
9461,Tried it on one leg only and it does work somewhat though it did not return my skin to what it looked like when I was 30.,4
9462,"Love!! Smells amazing, and received complements for having soft skin after using for just a week!",5
9463,I can't describe how much I love this product.  So much so I bought the scented body spray.  It smells so fresh clean and delicious,5

9466,the smell is perfect! I really love this product! My skin is very good with that!,5
9467,"Smells amazing and is moisturizing, I have no complaints here :)",5
9468,Not only do I see an improvement in my skin in two short weeks. This stuff smells like a dream. Will be repurchasing.,5
9469,Beautiful cream! Cheaper on Amazon then Sephora ..:),5
9470,The scent was very strong and unpleasant for me. I would not buy it again.,1
9471,Best lotion Ive ever used. Your skin literally  glistens in the sun! Super soft and smells great,5
9472,Love the scent and feel of the cream. A little pricey though.,5

9752,Excellent value and the very last sheet is as moist as the first.  Will purchase again.  Easily removes makeup and moisturizers skin.,5
9753,The quality is poor. Skimpy towels and kind of soapy.,2
9754,They weren't very moist...even when 1st opened. I put them into a Tupperware container and added a little bit of bottled water.,1
9755,I've ordered these about 3 times now.  Great price and great product.  Fast shipment.,5
9756,Very nice! They could even get off my Lime Crime Valentine lipstick! Nice variety and scents too! Love love!,5
9757,Works well for the money - However they sell for $1 a piece at Big Lots.. Will buy there going forward.,4
9758,Good gentle cleanser.  I use for personal wipes too.  Nice product.,4

9762,Love these does the job great left myvface soft and smelled wonderful. Definitely will be buying more,5
9763,just what I ordered to use when flying out of state.,5

9765,"Horrible quality. All three bags arrived broken and torn. Not even worth $1.99.
Extremely disappointing.",1
9766,"Love the bags,,,,,,,,,,,The clear plastic is very flexible and the zipper slides smoothly across the top!",5
9767,The plastic is not as strong as expected.  They will serve their purpose anyhow.,3
9768,"Works very well, does not suck up hair product, its portable and very easy to clean",5
9769,Works pretty good. A little inconsistent but less abrasive than the foam brush,4
9770,Not really worth the 14 dollars. Bends more than it twist,1
9771,Horrible buy!!! Don't suggest this product!!!,1
9772,This did not work for me. It was a waste of money and time. It did not do what it was suppose to.,1
9773,"They are thin plastic and chip very easily, will not be buying again. They look cute though.",2
9774,The acrylics look great but the glue was all dried up when it arrived.,1
9775,"flimsy as hell. paper thin, didn't even last a day. DON'T BUY",1
9776,"Pretty nails, but thin and they pop off or rip.",2
9777,These nails are gorgeous but are best for a single occasion. The glue isn't good quality and they get scratched or fall off very easily.,3
9778,I nothing good to about this nail. Shipping took forever and the nail didn't even look like nails. ,1
9779,Color not like in the picture. It looks more like dark burgundy,2
9780,Poor quality nails. Chip easily and fall off easily. Not worth the cost.,1
9781,"Very poorly made. The tips of the nails bent, and the color rubs off.",1
9782,worst artificial nails that I have ever purchased.  did not stay on.  I purchased them for a special occasion and ended up using something else.,1
9783,"I wasted my money i thought they would be very pretty they were cheap and wasteful, i need my money back.",1
9784,These nails are amazing and worth every penny. I got many complements about the nails. I would recommended these nails to everyone.,5

9788,"Love this product, i hope they don't discontinue it as it makes my hair shin. Fast shipping as well, thank u",5
9789,Great shine and texture.  You have to like the fragrance of this product to buy it a second time.,4
9790,Like this product a lot and don't understand why Loreal is making it so hard to find.,5
9791,"Love the product. I makes my hair so soft and shiny,",5
9792,Really a great product.  Produces the shine I was looking for and also has a pleasant fragrance.,5
9793,I have very thin hair...one of the best shine sprays I've used... very lightweight and shiny.,5
9794,"not what I thought it was , not well on bleached hair",3
9795,"The gloss did add some shine to my hair but I expected to really notice a difference.
The result was a very subtle shine.",4
9796,"Best, lightest most effective hair glosser I've found.",5
9797,"I had to learn not to spray to much,but its great if ya use just a little",4
9798,This is the best lipstick I currently own! I plan on returning and buying more.,5
9799,It's very smooth and easy to apply! :),5
9800,"I got the darkest color (Raven), and it wasn't matte at all. Just really greasy/messy.  :/",2
9801,Absolutely loved the color. The texture isn't my favorite but the best black matte lipstick i've found in a while.,4
9802,Love the way it makes my skin feel after swimming!  It also has a nice clean citrusy scent!,5
9803,It really works...  love that I don't leave the swimming pool with a chlorine smell on my skin any more.,5
9804,"Finally, I can get that chlorine smell off. Swimming multiple times a week can really dry out your skin, but this works great.",5
9805,Excellent for removing chlorine from my hair along with my skin. Love the smell too!,5
9806,Smells great and seems to work well - I use it after every swim and have definitely noticed that I my skin smells way less chlorinated!,5

9808,it looks really good just like everybody say there are nice,5
9809,Love it...bundles a little light and thin but it's great hair very soft...will buy again,4

9811,Love this plate. Love the designs and they pick up great.,5
9812,It stamps and the images are nice. The seller is a hit and miss for a couple dollars the leaves and petals stamp beautifully.,5
9813,Exactly what I expected...will shop with you again.,5
9814,It's a cape. So funny typing my boyfriend's unenthusiastic reviews.,5
9815,"Nice cape. I use it for at home coloring, styling and trims. It is fairly sturdy. Easy to brush off or wipe clean.",4
9816,"Serves its purpose, but wish it was littler wider for me but no complaints.",4
9817,As pictured but the neck clasp in the back is hard to keep closed and secure,4
9818,It does exactly what it's supposed to do: Keeps hair from going down my shirt. Works great!,5
9819,The product looks and feels of high quality. Will definitely buy again!,5
9820,They are large and have a lot of volume. Hard to find this quality!!,5
9821,I was looking for a softer scrubbie and these fit the bill.  Great quality and hold up for months.,5
9822,I like the item but I thought that they will last me long. It started to tear at the second week of use.,1
9823,"Nice, I like the frilly edges, makes it a little softer than normal ones. Helps liquid soaps lather so very well!",5
9824,Super fun skin and much cheaper than buying the deluxe PS4 with Vader on it.,4
9825,"Quality Product.  Thick, sticky, if you don't get it on the first time you can pull it off and re apply.",5
9826,5 stars takes a couple minutes to make sure you are putting the right stickers on the right side but all in all went very smoothly,5
9827,Great skin! Gives your PS4 a totally different awesome look!,5
9828,"This skin is great. Easy to install and if it were mistakenly adhered, you can reposition and reinstall it without problem. Look like a new console..",5
9829,Fits perfect. Great gift for my Star Wars lovers!,5
9830,The product is high quality. Everyone thought is was a special edition PS4. I even bought the game and made my own bundle.,5
9831,I like the way it look.. But??.. the glue is not that great.. time will tell.,3
9832,"Amazing quality, especially for the price. It also came incredibly fast. Will be buying more from this company!",5
9833,"I HATE THIS WIG!  The hair is frizzy, and impossible to style.",1
9834,Arrived sooner than I expected which is good. The wig is good quality and looks very nice. Very happy with this product.,5
9835,It was so small is couldn't fit my head! Ended up not even wearing it.,1
9836,If you are traveling and your hands are dirty good luck getting this open!,3

9863,as it came i opened the package and it was broken in three places and broke in half and the rinestones fell off.,1
